;;; Commentary:
;; This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in
;; emacspeak.
;; @subsection Design goal:
;;
;; @itemize
;; @item   Auditory icons should be used to
;; provide additional feedback, not as a gimmick.
;; @item   The Emacspeak interface
;; should be usable at all times without the icons.
;; @item   General principle for when to use
;; an icon:
;; @item Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
;;@item  For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current
;; focus to the next choice, We speak the next choice, while
;; indicating the fact that something was selected with an auditory icon.
;;@item  This interface will assume the availability of a shell command
;; @code{play} that can take one or more sound files and play them.
;; @item This module provides  a mapping between names in the elisp world
;; and actual sound files.
;; @item icon-names are symbols; sound files  are fully-qualified file-names.
;; @item Modules that wish to use auditory icons
;; should use these names, instead of actual file names.
;; @item As of
;; Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes architecture for
;; auditory icons.  Sound files corresponding to a given theme are
;; found in appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-dir.
;; @item Contrast this with @code{prompts[ that dont belong to any theme.]}
;; @item The auditory icon player is configure via
;; custom option @code{emacspeak-play-program}.
;;@item  That custom setting handles the mapping to various play programs
;; from audio subsystems such as Pulseaudio, and Pipewire.
;; @end itemize
;; @subsection Designing Auditory Icons
;; Here are some notes on what I have learnt while designing and using
;; auditory icons over the years:
;; @enumerate
;;@item  Auditory icons should be short  --- use command @code{soxi} or
;; @code{;} in a dired buffer to see duration of a sound file. Use
;; the bundled themes as a guide.
;; @item Sounds have many properties, eg: duration, gain, pitch, at
;; the basic level.
;;@item  Even more important is the nature of the sound and what it sounds
;; like in the overall activity where that sound is used.
;; @item This is why  the gain of icons  @emph{should never be} normalized in
;; my view---  tuning icons is as complex as picking
;; colors from  a color palette.
;; @item The included themes have been optimized over years of use and
;; are primarily tuned for using with headphones.
;; @end enumerate
