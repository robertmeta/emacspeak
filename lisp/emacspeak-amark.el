;;; Commentary:

;; Structure emacspeak-amark holds a bookmark into an mp3 file
;; path:  filename containing  marked
;; name: Bookmark tag
;; Position: time offset from start

;;  This library will be used from emacspeak-m-player to set and jump
;; to bookmarks. Amarks are stored in a .amarks.am file in the working
;; directory.  It also provides a simple AMark Browser to use from a
;; directory containing mp3 files where Amarks have been created --
;; see @command{emacspeak-amarks-browse}.
;;  @command{emacspeak-amarks-bookshelf} brings up a @emph{AmarksBookshelf}
;; that can be used to  browse available Amark files.
