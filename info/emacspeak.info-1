2.1 How To Contribute To This Manual
====================================

This manual is organized as a series of chapters, with each chapter in a
separate file.  If you feel capable of contributing to a specific
section, send out a message to the Emacspeak mailing list
<mailto:emacspeak@emacspeak.net>, stating your intention to work on a
section.  You can then start adding content to a local copy of the
chapter to which you are contributing.  When you feel you have something
to submit, send out a Github Pull Request.

2.2 Authoring Guidelines
========================

For this manual to hang together and make sense to the new user at whom
it is targeted, contributors need to stick to a consistent style.  If
you plan to contribute content, you should take some time to read the
existing sections -- note that many of these are skeletal and the first
contributions will be to flesh these sections out.

   If you are familiar with texinfo, go ahead and mark up your content
using texinfo.  If you are not, simply author the documentation you
create as plain formatted ASCII. If you do submit files as texinfo
source, make sure to validate them at your end first by running the
files through ‘makeinfo’ -- badly created or malformed texinfo source
takes more time to fix than marking up straight text.

3 Background
************

Emacspeak was originally developed in late 1994 and released as Open
Source in May 1995.  Since then, the system has been regularly updated
every six months to provide an up-to-date _Audio Desktop_.  Here is a
brief overview of some of the significant aspects of the system, and the
lessons learnt from its development and use.  The work on Emacspeak was
presented at CHI96 and the co-located Assets96 conference in Vancouver,
BC. This overview is being written nearly 15 years later to trace the
impact of the work.

3.1 Speech-Enabling Applications
================================

The underlying thesis behind AsTeR (Audio System For Technical Readings)
and later Emacspeak is that information is display-independent.  This
leads to the insight that producing auditory renderings of information
starting from the true source of that information often produces better
renderings than those that result from working from a modality-specific
representation; thus, attempting to speak visually rendered information
can often prove sub-optimal.  AsTeR applied these ideas to documents
authored in LaTeX; Emacspeak generalized these ideas to user interfaces.

   Emacspeak was therefore designed from the ground-up to enable
applications generate their own spoken feedback, rather than having an
external software program construct the spoken feedback by responding to
events in its environment.

   In Emacspeak, theory meets practice to deliver a working
implementation; Emacspeak leverages the power of Emacs and its embedded
Lisp interpreter to inject spoken feedback into applications that run
within Emacs.  For a detailed overview on how the _advice_ mechanism in
Emacs is used, see the original Assets96 paper, as well as the chapter
on Emacspeak in the OReilly publication entitled Beautiful Code
(http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/publish-emacspeak-bc.html).

3.2 Audio Formatting And Aural CSS
==================================

AsTeR introduced the notion of _audio formatting_ a concept analogous to
the well-understood notion of visual formatting.  The work on AsTeR
coincided with the Web being at its infancy.  As the Web evolved to
acquire Cascaded Style Sheets (CSS), ideas from AsTeR were used to
define Aural CSS as an appendix to CSS1 in 1995.  Emacspeak proved an
ideal platform to prototype the ideas within Aural CSS -- first within
the Emacs/W3 browser.  Around this time, Emacs itself evolved to support
multiple fonts and _font-locking_ to implement syntax coloring for
various types of content.  Emacspeak applied the ideas of audio
formatting to create the auditory analog of _font-lock_ -- Emacspeak
calls this _voice locking_.

   Voice locking in Emacspeak continues to be a unique feature among
systems that provide auditory feedback.  Later in 1997, Emacspeak's
implementation was overhauled to use Aural CSS for all aspects of
voice-locking, rather than just for Web content.

3.3 Auditory Icons
==================

Emacspeak augments spoken feedback with short auditory icons that vastly
speed up interaction.  Combined with audio formatting, the resulting
experience is analogous to moving from a monochrome character-cell
display to a high-quality color display -- the overall user experience
is rich in comparison.  This enabled Emacspeak to explore innovative
means of auditory communication -- as an example, see my Assets-98 paper
entitled _Conversational Gestures For The Audio Desktop_ that details
how one can play Tetris on the Emacspeak desktop.

3.4 Summary
===========

The lessons learnt from developing Emacspeak are many -- here are a few
highlights:

   • A model for browsing tabular data -- see relevant chapter in my
     book _Auditory User Interfaces_

   • Audio formatting and Aural CSS

   • Auditory icons for efficient feedback.

   • Web widgets for rapid task completion on the Web.

   And many more than will fit this margin.

4 Introduction
**************

Emacspeak provides a complete audio desktop by speech-enabling all of
Emacs.

   In the past, screen reading programs have allowed visually impaired
users to get feedback using synthesized speech.  Such programs have been
commercially available for a long time.  Most of them originally ran on
PC's under DOS, and have moved over to the Windows environment.
However, screen-readers for the UNIX environment have been conspicuous
in their absence.  Note that this is now changing with the availability
of console-level Linux screenreaders such as ‘speakup’.  Such Linux
screenreaders provide the same level of UNIX accessibility provided in
the late 80's by PC terminal emulators running a DOS screenreader.  This
means that most visually impaired computer users face the additional
handicap of being DOS-impaired -- a far more serious problem:-)

   Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides complete speech access.
It is _not_ a screen-reader -- rather, it is a complete user environment
with built-in speech feedback.  Emacspeak has a significant advantage;
since it runs inside Emacs, a structure-sensitive, fully customizable
environment, Emacspeak has more context-specific information about what
it is speaking than its screenreader counterparts.  This is why
Emacspeak is not a "screenreader", it is a system that produces speech
output.

   A Traditional screen-reader speaks the content of the screen, leaving
it to the user to interpret the visual layout.  Emacspeak, on the other
hand, treats speech as a first-class output modality; it speaks the
information in a manner that is easy to comprehend when listening.

   The basic concepts used by Emacspeak are simple; all interactive
Emacs commands have been adapted to provide speech feedback.  Hence, you
use Emacs as normal; Emacspeak works behind the scene to give audio
feedback in addition to updating the screen.

   Emacspeak consists of a core speech system that provides speech and
audio services to the rest of the Emacspeak desktop;
application-specific extensions provide context-specific spoken feedback
using these services.  Emacspeak currently comes with speech extensions
for several popular Emacs subsystems and editing modes.  I would like to
thank their respective authors for their wonderful work which makes
Emacs more than a text editor(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) I have now been using Emacspeak under Linux as the only source of
speech feedback since 1994.

File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Quick Installation,  Next: Building And Testing The Speech Server,  Prev: Obtaining Emacspeak,  Up: Installation

5.2 Quick Installation
======================

Here are the quick installation instructions.  See the next section for
detailed installation instructions.

   Packages for Linux distributions such as Debian typically become
available on the WWW a few weeks or months after a new version is
released.  The instructions below are for building and installing
Emacspeak from the source distribution.  If you install one of the
prepackaged distributions, use the install instructions that come with
that package.

   • Obtain the source code -- either by downloading the tar.bz2 file
     for the latest release -- or by cloning the git repository.

          git clone https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak

   • Change to the ‘emacspeak’ directory.

   • Type ‘make config’ to configure the sources.

   • Type ‘make’ to compile the files.

   • Next, decide which text-to-speech engine you will be using, and
     proceed to install that engine.  Your choices are:

        • Open Source ESpeak on Linux.  Install the ESpeak packages for
          your system, then compile the Emacspeak ESpeak server by
          doing:

               cd servers/native-espeak
               make

        • ViaVoice Outloud (AKA Eloquent).  You need to purchase this
          engine from the voxin site.  That purchase will give you
          install-ready packages for installing the speech engine as
          well as Emacspeak.  See <https://voxin.oralux.net/rss.xml> for
          the latest packages, and <https://voxin.oralux.net> for the
          main Voxin Web site.

        • On the Mac, you can use the builtin Mac TTS engine --
          emacspeak comes with a speech server for that TTS engine
          written in Python.

   • Having installed and configured the TTS engine of your choice, and
     having built the associated speech server, set Emacspeak up to use
     that engine by setting environment variable ‘DTK_PROGRAM’.  If
     using ‘bash’ as your shell, add the line

          export DTK_PROGRAM=<ENGINE-NAME>

     to your ‘.bash_profile’.

     As an example, to use ESpeak, add

          export DTK_PROGRAM=espeak

   • Run it by adding the line

          (load-file "<EMACSPEAK-DIR>/lisp/emacspeak-setup.el")

     to the top of your .emacs file.

     In the above, <EMACSPEAK-DIR> refers to the directory where you
     unpacked the sources.

   See the next section for details on building and testing the speech
server.

5.3 Building And Testing The Speech Server
==========================================

5.3.1 Speech Servers
--------------------

Speech servers are located in the ‘emacspeak/servers’ directory.

   • ESpeak: ‘servers/espeak’.  This is a TCL script that uses a library
     built in ‘servers/native-espeak/’.

   • Dectalk: ‘servers/dtk-exp’.  This is a TCL script that does not
     depend on any native code.

   • Outloud: ‘servers/outloud’ or ‘servers/32-outloud’ (for 64-bit
     machines).  This is a TCL script that uses the library built in
     ‘servers/linux-outloud’.  Note that a checkout from GitHub gives
     you a prebuilt library -- however you will need to purchase the TTS
     engine from <http://voxin.oralux.net>.

   • Mac: ‘servers/mac’.  This is a Python script that binds to the
     native Mac TTS.

5.3.1.1 Testing The Selected Server.
....................................

Once you have picked the TTS engine to use, run the selected server
script at a shell prompt, e.g.  for the ‘espeak’ engine, execute:

     ./servers/espeak

   This will result in a TCL prompt.  Here, you can test the TTS engine
by typing

     q "this is a test."
     d

   You should hear the TTS engine speak the text.

   Type ‘s’ to stop speech.  You should see a TCL prompt when you
execute it.

   Quit this TCL session by typing ‘C-d’ (an end-of-file character).

6 Basic Usage.
**************

This chapter gives an overview of how to use Emacspeak; for a full
listing of Emacspeak keybindings, see *Note emacspeak::.  Note: This
documentation should be used in conjunction with the online Emacs info
pages that extensively document Emacs itself.  These sections briefly
describe the speech-enabling extensions.  However, they should not be
considered a substitute for reading the Emacs manual.  How successfully
you use Emacspeak will depend on how well you learn your Emacs.

   All Emacs navigation and editing commands have been speech enabled.
Thus, moving to the next or previous word, line or paragraph results in
the text around point being spoken.  Exactly how much text is spoken is
determined by the amount by which you moved.

   In addition, Emacspeak provides basic reading functions that can be
invoked to listen to chunks of text without moving.

File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Working,  Up: Basic Usage

6.1 Emacspeak Overview
======================

Emacspeak provides a small number of core services around which the
remainder of the audio interface is constructed.  These essential
features of the software are briefly outlined in the following
paragraphs; the commands by which they can be controlled will be
described later in the manual.

   Apart from providing a fluent spoken interface to all of Emacs' basic
editing functions, Emacspeak also includes software modules which add
speech feedback to a range of applications that can be run from within
Emacs.  In this sense, Emacspeak amounts to much more than a talking
text editor; indeed, it can more aptly be characterized as a true "audio
desktop", in which speech is treated as a first-class output modality.

   Emacspeak implements a special minor mode, known as "voice lock mode"
(*note Voice-lock::) which uses distinct speech characteristics to
provide aural highlighting of specific textual constructs, such as
comments in program code, quoted strings and reserved words *Note Voice
Lock::.  This facility is further extended when Emacspeak is used with
the ‘EWW’ and ‘W3’ Web browsers, to enable the semantic and structural
distinctions captured by the HTML markup to be communicated efficiently
*Note Web Browsing::.

   It is often desirable to exercise control over the pronunciation of a
word (E.G. a technical term or a reserved word in a programming
language) within specific contexts.  Emacspeak maintains pronunciation
dictionaries for this purpose, which may be customized by the user.
Moreover, individual dictionaries can be activated selectively,
depending for example on the current major mode or the name of the file
which is being visited *Note emacspeak-pronounce::.

   In addition to spoken feedback, Emacspeak can generate "auditory
icons" -- short sound cues which alert the user to significant events,
for example the opening or deletion of a file, the completion of an
action, the arrival of an electronic mail message or the creation of a
completion buffer.  Sound cues act as a supplement to the spoken
interface, and are especially valuable to the experienced user in
facilitating rapid interaction.  Note that in order to support auditory
icons, the computer must be equipped with sound hardware for which the
operating system has been correctly configured *Note emacspeak-sounds::.

6.2 Using Emacs Buffers
=======================

While typing in an Emacs buffer, hitting space speaks the recently typed
word.  I use completion all the time; so Emacspeak will speak the
completion just inserted as well as the next possible completion.  In
Emacs, use ‘M-x load-library <RETURN> completion <RETURN>’ for loading
the completion package.

   The standard Emacs prompting functions have also been speech-enabled.
Emacs prompts with available lists of completions in response to partial
input wherever appropriate -- all forms of completion provide speech
feedback.

   In addition, Emacspeak provides a number of commands for reading
portions of the current buffer, getting status information, and
modifying Emacspeak's state.

   All of the commands are documented in the subsequent sections.  They
can be classified into types:

   • Emacspeak commands for listening to chunks of information.  The
     names of these commands all start with the common prefix
     ‘emacspeak-speak-’.  All Emacspeak commands are bound to the keymap
     EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and are accessed with the key ‘C-e’(1).  Thus, the
     Emacspeak command “emacspeak-speak-line” is bound to ‘l’ in keymap
     EMACSPEAK-KEYMAP and can be accessed with the keystroke ‘C-e l’.
     If for some reason you wish to use some key other than ‘C-e’ as the
     common keyboard prefix for all Emacspeak commands, set the variable
     EMACSPEAK-PREFIX.

   • The second category of commands provided by Emacspeak manipulate
     the state of the speech device.  The names of these commands start
     with the common prefix ‘dtk-’ and are bound in keymap
     EMACSPEAK-DTK-SUBMAP.

     You can access these commands via the prefix ‘C-e d’ (2).  Thus,
     the command “dtk-set-rate” is bound to ‘r’ in keymap
     EMACSPEAK-DTK-SUBMAP and can be executed by pressing ‘C-e d r’.

   Emacs has extensive online help; so does emacspeak.  Please use it.

   This info manual is only to get you started.  You can get a summary
of Emacspeak's features by pressing ‘C-h C-e’

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) C-e is mnemonic for Emacspeak.

   (2) Historically, d was mnemonic for Dectalk; note that nothing in
Emacspeak is DECTalk specific.

6.3 Reading Without Moving
==========================

Emacspeak speaks information as you move around within a buffer.  How
much text is spoken depends on how you move, thus, when you move by
words, you hear the current word; when you move by paragraphs, you hear
the current paragraph spoken.  In addition, the following commands allow
you to listen to information without moving point (point is emacs
terminology for the editing cursor).

   Reading without moving point:

‘C-e c’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-char’

     Speak character under point.  Pronounces character phonetically
     unless called with a PREFIX arg.

‘C-e w’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-word’

     Speak current word.  With prefix ARG, speaks the rest of the word
     from point.  Negative prefix arg speaks from start of word to
     point.  If executed on the same buffer position a second time, the
     word is spelled instead of being spoken.

‘C-e l’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-line’

     Speaks current line.  With prefix ARG, speaks the rest of the line
     from point.  Negative prefix optional arg speaks from start of line
     to point.  Voicifies if option 'voice-lock-mode' is on.  Indicates
     indentation with a tone or a spoken cue if audio indentation is in
     use.  Indicates position of point with an aural highlight if option
     'emacspeak-show-point' is turned on -- see command
     ‘emacspeak-show-point’ bound to ‘C-e C-d’.  Lines that start hidden
     blocks of text, e.g.  outline header lines, or header lines of
     blocks created by command 'emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block' are
     indicated with auditory icon ellipses.

‘C-e <UP>’
     ‘emacspeak-read-previous-line’

     Read previous line, specified by an offset, without moving.
     Default is to read the previous line.

‘C-e <DOWN>’
     ‘emacspeak-read-next-line’

     Read next line, specified by an offset, without moving.  Default is
     to read the next line.

‘C-e p’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-paragraph’

     Speak paragraph.  With prefix arg, speaks rest of current
     paragraph.  Negative prefix arg will read from start of current
     paragraph to point.  If voice-lock-mode is on, then it will use any
     defined personality.

‘C-e r’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-region’

     Speak current region delimited by “point” and “mark”.  When called
     from a program, argument START and END specify region to speak.

‘C-e cap R’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-rectangle’

     Speak a rectangle of text.  Rectangle is delimited by point and
     mark.  When call from a program, arguments specify the START and
     END of the rectangle.

‘C-e b’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-buffer’

     Speak current buffer contents.  With prefix ARG, speaks the rest of
     the buffer from point.  Negative prefix arg speaks from start of
     buffer to point.  If voice lock mode is on, the paragraphs in the
     buffer are voice annotated first, see command
     ‘emacspeak-speak-voice-annotate-paragraphs’.  This provides the
     auditory equivalent of _dropped caps_ from visual typography.

‘C-e n’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-rest-of-buffer’

     Speak remainder of the buffer starting at point

‘C-e /’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display’

     Speak this buffer as displayed in a different frame.  Emacs allows
     you to display the same buffer in multiple windows or frames.
     These different windows can display different portions of the
     buffer.  This is equivalent to leaving a book open at places at
     once.  This command allows you to listen to the places where you
     have left the book open.  The number used to invoke this command
     specifies which of the displays you wish to speak.  Typically you
     will have two or at most three such displays open.  The current
     display is 0, the next is 1, and so on.  Optional argument ARG
     specifies the display to speak.

‘C-e <LEFT>’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-previous-display’

     Speak this buffer as displayed in a 'previous' window.  See
     documentation for command
     ‘emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display’ for the meaning
     of 'previous'.

‘C-e <RIGHT>’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-next-display’

     Speak this buffer as displayed in a 'previous' window.  See
     documentation for command
     ‘emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display’ for the meaning
     of 'previous'.

‘C-e [’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-page’

     Speak a page.  With prefix ARG, speaks rest of current page.
     Negative prefix arg will read from start of current page to point.
     If option 'voice-lock-mode' is on, then it will use any defined
     personality.

‘C-e DIGIT’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-predefined-window’

     Speak one of the first 10 windows on the screen.  In general,
     you'll never have Emacs split the screen into more than two or
     three.  Argument ARG determines the 'other' window to speak.
     Speaks entire window irrespective of point.  Semantics of 'other'
     is the same as for the builtin Emacs command 'other-window'.

‘C-e C-n’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-next-window’

     Speak the next window.

‘C-e C-p’
     ‘emacspeak-speak-previous-window’

     Speak the previous window.

‘emacspeak-speak-other-window’
     Speak contents of 'other' window.  Speaks entire window
     irrespective of point.  Semantics of 'other' is the same as for the
     builtin Emacs command 'other-window'.  Optional argument ARG
     specifies 'other' window to speak.

‘<ESCAPE> <UP>’
     ‘emacspeak-owindow-previous-line’

     Move to the next line in the other window and speak it.  Numeric
     prefix arg COUNT specifies number of lines to move.

‘<ESCAPE> <DOWN>’
     ‘emacspeak-owindow-next-line’

     Move to the next line in the other window and speak it.  Numeric
     prefix arg COUNT can specify number of lines to move.

‘<ESCAPE> next’
     ‘emacspeak-owindow-scroll-up’

     Scroll up the window that command 'other-window' would move to.
     Speak the window contents after scrolling.

‘<ESCAPE> prior’
     ‘emacspeak-owindow-scroll-down’

     Scroll down the window that command 'other-window' would move to.
     Speak the window contents after scrolling.

‘emacspeak-speak-sexp’
     Speak current sexp.  With prefix ARG, speaks the rest of the sexp
     from point.  Negative prefix arg speaks from start of sexp to
     point.

6.4 Speech System Commands
==========================

This section documents Emacspeak's various user commands for controlling
the text to speech (TTS) system.

* Menu:

* Controlling Echo::             Character, Word and Line Echo.
* Speech Output  Control::       Indicating case, capitalization and indentation.
* Miscellaneous:: Miscellaneous TTS Commands.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Controlling Echo,  Next: Speech Output Control,  Up: Speech System

6.4.1 Character, Word And Line Echo.
------------------------------------

By default, Emacspeak speaks characters as they are typed -- this is
called character echo; Words are spoken as they are completed -- this is
called word echo.  Emacspeak can also optionally speak each line as it
is typed -- this is called line echo.

   Character, word and line echo can be toggled -- either in the current
buffer -- or for all buffers (globally).  To toggle the specific echo
functionality for all buffers, precede the specific command with ‘C-u’.
Note that in the documentation below, this use of ‘C-u’ is indicated
using the common Emacs terminology of _prefix arg_ or _interactive
prefix arg_.

‘C-e d k’
     ‘emacspeak-toggle-character-echo’

     Toggle state of Emacspeak character echo.  Interactive PREFIX arg
     means toggle the global default value, and then set the current
     local value to the result.

‘C-e d w’
     ‘emacspeak-toggle-word-echo’

     Toggle state of Emacspeak word echo.  Interactive PREFIX arg means
     toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
     value to the result.

‘C-e d l’
     ‘emacspeak-toggle-line-echo’

     Toggle state of Emacspeak line echo.  Interactive PREFIX arg means
     toggle the global default value, and then set the current local
     value to the result.

6.4.2 Setting TTS Characteristics.
----------------------------------

Emacspeak user commands can set different characteristics of the speech
output such as speech rate and punctuations mode.

   Emacspeak provides a number of settings that affect how attributes of
the text such as capitalization are conveyed.  These include settings
that produce a short tone for each upper case letter, as well as a smart
mode for speaking mixed case words which is especially useful when
programming.  These settings can be made locally in a given buffer or be
applied to all buffers by preceding these commands with ‘C-u’.

‘C-e d r’
     ‘dtk-set-rate’

     Set speaking RATE for the TTS.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
     the global default value, and then set the current local value to
     the result.

‘C-e d f’
     ‘dtk-set-character-scale’

     Set scale FACTOR for speech rate.  Speech rate is scaled by this
     factor when speaking characters.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
     the global default value, and then set the current local value to
     the result.

     This function is advised.

     Before-advice 'emacspeak-auto': Automatically defined advice to
     speak interactive prompts.

‘C-e d DIGIT’
     ‘dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate’

     Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels using digit keys
     ‘0’ through ‘9’.  Interactive PREFIX arg says to set the rate
     globally.

‘C-e d p’
     ‘dtk-set-punctuations’

     Set punctuation mode to MODE. Possible values are 'some', 'all', or
     'none'.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set the global default value,
     and then set the current local value to the result.

‘C-e d m’
     ‘dtk-set-pronunciation-mode’

     Set pronunciation MODE. This command is valid only for newer
     Dectalks, e.g.  the Dectalk Express.  Possible values are 'math,
     name, europe, spell', all of which can be turned on or off.
     Argument STATE specifies new state.

‘C-e d s’
     ‘dtk-toggle-split-caps’

     Toggle split caps mode.  Split caps mode is useful when reading
     Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
     means toggle the global default value, and then set the current
     local value to the result.  ‘dtk-toggle-caps’
‘C-e d c’

     Toggle capitalization.  when set, capitalization is indicated by a
     _cap_ before the word, and upper-case words are indicated with a
     _acc_ before the word.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the
     global default value, and then set the current local value to the
     result.

   In addition, Emacspeak can convey the indentation of lines as they
are spoken -- This is relevant when programming and is the default when
working with program source.

‘C-e d i’
     ‘emacspeak-toggle-audio-indentation’

     Toggle state of Emacspeak audio indentation.  Interactive PREFIX
     arg means toggle the global default value, and then set the current
     local value to the result.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Speech Output Control,  Up: Speech System

6.4.3 Miscellaneous Speech Commands
-----------------------------------

Speech can be stopped using command ‘dtk-stop’ -- though in normal use,
the action of moving the cursor will stop ongoing speech.  The speech
server can be stopped and restarted for cases where the user wants to
switch to a different server -- or in the rare case to nuke a runaway
speech server.

‘C-e s’
     dtk-stop

     Stop speech now.

‘C-e d q’
     ‘dtk-toggle-quiet’

     Toggle state of the speech device between being quiet and
     talkative.  Useful if you want to continue using an Emacs session
     that has emacspeak loaded but wish to make the speech shut up.
     Optional argument PREFIX specifies whether speech is turned off in
     the current buffer or in all buffers.

‘C-e C-s’
     ‘dtk-emergency-restart’

     Use this to nuke the currently running dtk server and restart it.
     Useful if you want to switch to another synthesizer while emacspeak
     is running.  Also useful for emergency stopping of speech.

   Finally, here are the remaining commands available via the TTS
related keymap ‘C-e d’.

‘C-e d a’
     ‘dtk-add-cleanup-pattern’

     Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that are cleaned
     up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes this pattern if
     previously added.  Cleaning up repeated patterns results in
     emacspeak speaking the pattern followed by a repeat count instead
     of speaking all the characters making up the pattern.  Thus, by
     adding the repeating pattern '.'  (this is already added by
     default) emacspeak will say "aw fifteen dot" when speaking the
     string "..............."  instead of "period period period period".

‘C-e d d’
     ‘dtk-select-server’

     Select a speech server interactively.  This will be the server that
     is used when you next call either M-x dtk-initialize or C-e C-s.
     Argument PROGRAM specifies the speech server program.

‘C-e d <SPACE>’
     ‘dtk-toggle-splitting-on-white-space’

     Toggle splitting of speech on white space.  This affects the
     internal state of emacspeak that decides if we split text purely by
     clause boundaries, or also include whitespace.  By default,
     emacspeak sends a clause at a time to the speech device.  This
     produces fluent speech for normal use.  However in modes such as
     'shell-mode' and some programming language modes, clause markers
     appear infrequently, and this can result in large amounts of text
     being sent to the speech device at once, making the system
     unresponsive when asked to stop talking.  Splitting on white space
     makes emacspeak's stop command responsive.  However, when splitting
     on white space, the speech sounds choppy since the synthesizer is
     getting a word at a time.

‘C-e d <RETURN>’
     ‘dtk-set-chunk-separator-syntax’

     Interactively set how text is split in chunks.  See the Emacs
     documentation on syntax tables for details on how characters are
     classified into various syntactic classes.  Argument S specifies
     the syntax class.

‘C-e d t’
     ‘emacspeak-dial-dtk’

     Prompt for and dial a phone NUMBER with the Dectalk.

‘C-e d cap V’
     ‘tts-speak-version’

     Use this to find out which version of the TTS firmware you are
     running.

‘C-e d z’
     ‘emacspeak-zap-dtk’

     Send this command to the TTS engine directly.

6.5 Voice Lock Mode
===================

The status of voice lock mode can be toggled on and off in the current
buffer by issuing the command ‘C-e d v’ (M-x voice-lock-toggle).

   Voice-lock is turned on automatically in all buffers that support it
when Emacspeak is started.

   Emacspeak can be set to disable voice lock in all of the major modes
that support it.  To do so, insert the following statement into your
Emacs initialization file:

     (global-voice-lock-mode -1)

   The characteristics of the different voice personalities used by
voice lock mode vary according to the capabilities of the speech
synthesizer.  The definitions applicable to the Dectalk family of
synthesizers are contained in ‘dectalk-voices.el’, which is supplied as
part of the Emacspeak distribution.  The Emacspeak distribution also
contains voice definitions for many other synthesizers.

   Using voice lock mode, Emacspeak also supports many of the aural
style properties defined in level 2 of the World Wide Web Consortium's
Cascading Style Sheet specification (see
<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/>.  Thus, when Emacspeak is running in
conjunction with a cooperating user agent, such as William Perry's
Emacspeak/W3 web browser, the rendering of HTML documents can be
regulated by style sheets.  Examples of style rules which employ the CSS
audio properties can be found in the default style sheet which is
supplied in the Emacs/W3 distribution.

7 The Emacspeak Audio Desktop.
******************************

This chapter describes the Emacspeak audio desktop and gives tips and
tricks for making use of many of Emacs' powerful features.

   The desktop is the work area where you organize the tools of your
trade and the information objects relevant to your current activities.
In the conventional world of visual GUI (Graphical User Interface)-based
computing, these tools and information objects manifest themselves as a
collection of icons organized in a two-dimensional work-area -- this
organization is designed to place frequently used objects within easy
reach.

   Notice that organizing one's work area in terms of visual icons
arranged in a two-dimensional area where such an organization is
optimized for the available "conversational gestures" of pointing and
clicking is an artifact of visual interaction.

   In the spirit of a truly speech-enabled application, Emacspeak does
not simply provide you spoken access to a particular presentation of
your work environment that was initially designed with the "sign
language" of visual interaction in mind.  Instead, Emacspeak enables you
to work with documents and other information objects in a manner that is
optimized to aural, eyes-free interaction.  A necessary consequence of
this setup is that users accustomed to the purely visual manifestation
of today's electronic desktop do not immediately perceive the Emacspeak
environment as an electronic desktop.  This section of the manual hopes
to introduce you to a work-style that encourages a different perspective
on how one interacts with the computer in performing day-to-day
computing tasks.

   The end result in my case has been a marked increase in personal
productivity.

File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Desktop Objects,  Next: Object Oriented Desktop,  Up: Audio Desktop

7.1 Objects Making Up The Emacspeak Desktop
===========================================

A "buffer" is the basic building block of the Emacspeak desktop.  Any
information presented by Emacs is placed in a "buffer".  For example,
when perusing this manual within Emacs, the "file" containing the
documentation is presented in a "buffer".  All information objects such
as WWW pages, email messages, output from user interaction with
command-line shells etc., are presented by Emacs in individual
"buffers".

   Buffers provide a base level of user interaction; Emacs derives its
power by allowing applications to specialize buffers to enable specific
types of user-interaction that is optimized for a specific class of
information.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Object Oriented Desktop,  Next: Context-Sensitive Interaction,  Prev: Desktop Objects,  Up: Audio Desktop

7.2 An Object-Oriented Desktop
==============================

The basic "buffer object" can be specialized by Emacs applications to
provide optimal interaction.  This kind of specialization makes the
Emacs environment an object-oriented environment; thus, the basic
conversational gesture of "move to the next statement" can be assigned
behavior that is appropriate to the content that the user is currently
navigating.  As an example of such specialization, Emacs provides
"specialized modes" for working with English text, programming
languages, markup source e.g.  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or LaTeX
documents and so on.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Context-Sensitive Interaction,  Prev: Object Oriented Desktop,  Up: Audio Desktop

7.3 Emacspeak Specializes Aural Interaction
===========================================

The content-specific user interaction described above is a very powerful
feature of Emacs, and this is where Emacspeak derives its power.
Traditionally, the ability to create buffers specialized for working
with specific content-types has been used by the Emacs community to
develop versatile programming environments, messaging applications such
as mail and news readers, and authoring environments.  The clean design
present in all of these Emacs extensions in terms of separating
application functionality from the user-interface, combined with the
availability of the entire source code making up these packages under
the open-source model has laid the ground-work for developing Emacspeak
as a versatile aural counterpart to the product of years of software
engineering that has been invested by the Emacs community.  In short,
Emacspeak would not exist in its present shape or form without this
prior effort.

7.3.1 Audio Formatted Output
----------------------------

Emacspeak takes advantage of the content-specific knowledge available
within specialized buffers to produce "audio formatted" output designed
to optimize user interaction.  A basic consequence of the above is
"voice locking" in specialized modes; a more interesting consequence is
the implementation of Aural Cascading Style Sheets (ACSS) in conjunction
with the Emacs EWW (Emacs Web Wowser) and W3 Web browsers.

7.3.2 Structured Navigation:
----------------------------

Emacspeak also exploits content-specific knowledge to provide structured
navigation of different types of electronic content.  In many cases,
such structured navigation is an extension of what Emacs provides by
default; in other cases, Emacspeak implements the necessary extensions
to provide the level of structural navigation needed to work efficiently
in an eyes-free environment.

   Notable among such structured navigation is Emacs' powerful outline
feature.

   An example of content-sensitive navigation is provided by the ‘imenu’
package which dynamically creates a "table of contents" based on the
content that is being displayed in a given buffer.  Emacs “Selective
Display” lets one easily hide and expose portions of a buffer based on
indentation -- this feature can be used to advantage when working with
program source code.

7.3.3 Navigating The Desktop
----------------------------

In addition to navigating individual information objects, the Emacspeak
environment provides speech-enabled navigation of the various buffers
that are currently open on the Emacspeak desktop via Emacs' built-in
list-buffers feature.  Emacs' dired -- directory editor -- for browsing
the file system, along with the new speedbar package that combines
features from dired and imenu round off the suite of navigational tools.

7.3.4 Everything Is Searchable:
-------------------------------

Emacs derives one final advantage from using buffers as the basic
building block for the entire desktop.  Every Emacs buffer is searchable
via a uniform and powerful search interface.  Emacs' incremental search
works efficiently and consistently to enable you locate "objects" of
interest either within a given document or to locate a given object from
among the various objects that are currently open on the Emacspeak
desktop.  This is very powerful -- where a GUI (Graphical User
Interface) user is typically limited to quickly locating an object from
a relatively small collection -- the size of the collection being a
direct function of available display real-estate -- the Emacspeak user
can typically work with a far larger collection of objects.  This is
well-suited to the eyes-free environment, where display real-estate has
no meaning; so bringing up a list of currently open buffers and
performing an incremental search to locate a specific buffer is just as
efficient independent of whether you have a few dozen or a few hundred
buffers open.

   To illustrate the above, my typical working Emacs session lasts
between two and three weeks -- over that time I typically accumulate
several hundred open buffers holding a large variety of content ranging
from program source code to email messages and WWW pages.

   Ubiquitous search in the eyes-free environment is critical -- as a
comparison, when using a conventional, purely visual WWW browser, users
have no means of easily "searching" for say the "submit" button on a WWW
page.  This inability is a minor annoyance in visual interaction, and
the typical mouse-enabled user never uses the find dialog to find a
submit button -- it is simply more efficient to point at the submit
button given the eye's ability to quickly scan the two-dimensional
display.  This luxury is absent in an eyes-free environment; as a
consequence, blind users confronted by the combination of a visual
interface and screen-reader are typically limited to either tabbing
through all the controls on a WWW page, or using the sub-optimal find
dialog.

8 Voice Lock
************

See <http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/blog/voice-lock-refreshed.html>
for a high-level overview of how Emacspeak Voice-Lock has evolved over
the years.

  1. Emacspeak defines a number of voice overlays such as
     ‘voice-bolden’, and ‘voice-lighten’ that can be applied to a given
     voice to change what it sounds like.

  2. Voice overlays are defined in terms of Aural CSS (ACSS
     (http://www.w3.org/tr/css2/aural.html)) to keep them independent of
     a specific TTS engine.

  3. For each such overlay there is a corresponding
     ‘<OVERLAY-NAME>-settings’ variable that can be customized via
     custom.

  4. The numbers in ‘voice-bolden-settings’ as an example:

Setting                              Value
family                               nil
average-pitch                        1
pitch-range                          6
stress                               6
richness                             nil
punctuation                          nil

   Unset values (‘nil’) show up as "unspecified" in the customize
interface.

  1. Do not directly customize ‘voice-bolden’ and friends, instead
     customize the corresponding ‘voice-bolden-settings’, since that
     ensures that all voices that are defined in terms of ‘voice-bolden’
     get correctly updated.

  2. Discovering what to customize:

   Command ‘emacspeak-show-personality-at-point’ (bound by default to
C-e M-v) will show you the value of properties personality and face at
point.  Describe-variable on these names should tell you what to
customize; so as an example:

   Put point on a comment line, and hit ‘C-e M-v’: you will hear

     Personality emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality
     Face font-lock-comment-delimiter-face

   Describe-variable of ‘emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality’
gives:

     emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality's value is acss-p0-s0-all

     Documentation: Personality used for font-lock-comment-face This
     personality uses voice-monotone whose effect can be changed globally
     by customizing voice-monotone-settings.

8.1 How It All Works
====================

Here is a brief explanation of the connection between ‘voice-bolden’ and
its associated ‘voice-bolden-settings’.

  1. Voice settings are initially in ‘voice-bolden-settings’ which is a
     list of numbers.

  2. That list of numbers needs to be translated to appropriate
     device-specific codes to send to the TTS engine.

  3. You do not want to do this translation _each_ time you speak
     something.

  4. So when ‘voice-bolden’ is defined, the definition happens in two
     steps:

        • The list of settings is stored away in
          ‘voice-bolden-settings’,

        • A corresponding voice-name is generated --
          ‘acss-a<n>-p<n>-r<n>-s<n>’ and the corresponding control codes
          to send to the device are stored away in a hash-table keyed by
          the above symbol.

        • Finally, ‘voice-bolden’ is assigned the above symbol.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: What this gives.,  Prev: How It All Works.,  Up: Voice Lock

8.2 What this gives
===================

  1. The ability to customize the voice via custom by editing the list
     of numbers in ‘voice-bolden-settings’

  2. When that list is edited, ‘voice-bolden’ is arranged to be updated
     automatically.

   The following additional commands from module *Note
emacspeak-wizards::, are useful when designing aural styles.

  1. ‘emacspeak-wizards-generate-voice-sampler’

     Generate a buffer containing text that demonstrates the effect of
     various aural settings.

  2. ‘emacspeak-wizards-voice-sampler’

     Applied specified aural style to text in current region.

9 Using Online Help With Emacspeak.
***********************************

Emacs provides an extensive online help system for helping you learn
about various aspects of using Emacs.  Emacspeak provides online help
for its various extensions using this same help system.  This chapter
explains how to use the online help facilities in order to empower you
in discovering powerful and versatile working techniques that will make
you more and more productive in your day to day computing.

   The online help options are accessed via the ‘C-h’ prefix key, which
must be followed by an additional letter or control character to
designate the kind of help desired.  For example, ‘C-h t’
‘help-with-tutorial’ visits the Emacs tutorial in a new buffer; ‘C-h i’
‘info’ enters the Info documentation system, from which you can read
Texinfo manuals that have been installed on your system, including the
Emacs and Emacspeak documentation; and ‘C-h k’ ‘describe-key’ provides a
description of the Emacs function which is bound to the next key that
you type.  For learning about the various options that are available via
the ‘C-h’ mechanism described above, view the online help for command
‘help-for-help’ bound to ‘C-h C-h’ -- using what has been described so
far, you would achieve this by pressing ‘C-h k’ followed by ‘C-h C-h’.

   Emacspeak users should note that online help is typically displayed
in a separate Emacs window.  Where it makes sense to do so, Emacspeak
will automatically speak the displayed help.  Once you've asked for
help, you can hear the displayed documentation as many times as you wish
using Emacspeak command ‘emacspeak-speak-help’ bound to ‘C-e h’.  If you
want to move through the displayed help a line at a time, switch to the
buffer where the help is displayed -- the buffer is called ‘*Help*’.

   Often, in adding an auditory interface to an Emacs extension, such as
a web browser or mail reader, Emacspeak defines additional commands and
key bindings which enhance the functionality of the spoken feedback
provided by the application.  This manual does not purport to document
all such commands.  It is important, therefore, when learning to use the
various Emacs extensions which comprise the 'audio desktop' (*note Audio
Desktop::) that you take advantage of online help to obtain details of
any context-specific features provided by Emacspeak.  The following two
commands are of particular importance in this regard:

   • ‘C-h m’ ‘describe-mode’ explains which major and minor modes are
     currently in effect, and lists the commands and key bindings
     associated with them.

   • ‘C-h b’ ‘describe-bindings’ lists all of the key bindings which are
     currently defined.

   The importance of these help functions can be illustrated by the
Emacs/W3 web browser.  When point is positioned inside a table, certain
key bindings are established with which you can access Emacspeak
commands that make it possible to read the rows and columns of the table
and explore its structure efficiently.  To get a description of these
key bindings, you can use W3 to visit the sample HTML file supplied as
part of the Emacspeak distribution, and, after having moved point onto
the first row of the table, issue the command ‘C-h m’ ‘describe-mode’ to
create a help buffer containing an explanation of the features offered
by W3 mode.

   Emacspeak supplements the online help facilities available within
Emacs by defining several commands of its own, as follows:

   • ‘C-h c-e’ ‘describe-emacspeak’ presents a list of standard
     Emacspeak commands.

   • ‘C-e F’ ‘emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq’ opens a new buffer
     containing the Emacspeak FAQ, a list of frequently asked questions
     about Emacspeak together with their answers.

   • ‘C-e <F1>’ ‘emacspeak-learn-mode’ enters a mode in which the
     function of every key that you type is spoken; this mode can be
     terminated with the ‘C-g’ ‘keyboard-quit’ command.

10 Emacs Packages.
******************

Emacs -- The extensible, self-documenting editor, derives its
functionality from its powerful extension mechanism.  This extension
mechanism is used to implement many user-level applications such as mail
readers, web browsers, software development environments and so on.
This chapter gives directions on how to locate the right Emacs package
for addressing specific tasks.  The chapter is organized into logical
sections that each pertain to a specific class of tasks; in individual
subsections within a section give a brief overview of particular Emacs
packages that have been speech-enabled.

   For a categorized list of speech-enabled applications on theEmacspeak
desktop, see <http://emacspeak.sf.net/applications.html>.  In Emacs 24
and later, you can use Emacs' builtin package manager to install and
update packages.

10.1 Document Authoring
=======================

The Emacspeak environment provides a rich collection of structured
document authoring tools.  These are well-suited for working in an
eyes-free environment -- you clearly do not want to use a What You See
Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) authoring tool if you cannot see what you're
getting.  Structure-based authoring tools allow you to focus on the act
of content creation, leaving the minutiae of visual layout to the
computer.

* Search replace and spell check:: Fixing errors.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Creating Well-formatted Documents,  Next: Search replace and spell check,  Up: Document Authoring

10.1.1 Creating Well-formatted Documents
----------------------------------------

Before authoring a document, decide its primary audience.  If the
document contains relatively simple content, e.g., no mathematical
equations etc.  and is primarily targeted at the web, you are probably
better off using HTML. You can create well-structured HTML documents
with the help of package ‘nxml-mode’ for editing XML documents.  Another
option is to use ‘org-mode’ to create a Wiki-like text document that can
be easily published to multiple output formats including HTML.

   Packages ‘org-mode’ and ‘nxml-mode’ are speech-enabled by Emacspeak
to provide auditory icons, structured navigation and outlines, as well
as voice locking for audio formatted feedback as you work.

   If the document being authored is more complex, you are usually
better off creating it in LaTeX.  Note that LaTeX documents can be
converted to HTML either via package ‘tex4ht’ -- available on the WWW.

   The TeX family of typesetting languages is suitable for producing
well-formatted documents in an eyes-free environment.  Unlike WYSIWYG
environments, the author of a TeX or LaTeX document works with the
content of the document, leaving it to the formatting system (TeX) to
format the document for good visual presentation.

   The ‘AUCTeX’ package is an Emacs extension that facilitates authoring
and maintaining structured documents in TeX and LaTeX.  Package ‘bibtex’
facilitates maintenance and use of ‘bibtex’ bibliography databases.  The
Texinfo package allows creation of software documentation that is
suitable for both printing as well as online viewing as hypertext.
Emacspeak speech-enables packages ‘AUCTeX’, ‘bibtex’ and ‘texinfo’ to
provide convenient spoken feedback as you create documents.  For details
on using these packages, see their accompanying online info
documentation.

   As the document preparation system of choice, Emacspeak supports a
fluent speech-enabled interface to editing and formatting LaTeX
documents.  This interface is provided by speech-enabling _AUCTeX_ mode.

   Mode _AUCTeX_ provides efficient keyboard shortcuts for inserting and
maintaining LaTeX markup as a document is being authored.  All of these
editing commands provide succinct auditory feedback when used with
Emacspeak.  The syntax coloring provided by this mode is extended to
provide _voice locking_ -- consequently, Emacspeak uses different voices
to speak the embedded markup to set it apart from the content.

   Mode _AUCTeX_ can be used to create empty document templates and to
insert document content at the appropriate places in the template.  The
mode also enables structured navigation of the document as it is being
edited.  Emacspeak speech-enables these template creation and structured
navigation commands to produce auditory icons and succinct spoken
feedback.  For example, while editing, the user can quickly browse
through the sections of the document and have each section title spoken.
Document elements such as paragraphs and bulleted lists can be
manipulated as logical units.  These features are especially relevant in
an eyes-free environment where the user needs to select logical parts of
the document without having to point at portions of a visual display.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Search replace and spell check,  Prev: Creating Well-formatted Documents,  Up: Document Authoring

10.1.2 Searching, Replacing, And Spell Checking
-----------------------------------------------

Incremental search, a process by which the system prompts the user for a
search string and moves the selection to the next available match while
allowing the user to add more characters to the search string, is the
search technique of choice among most Emacs users.  As the system
successively finds each match, it provides the user the option of
continuing the search.  Incremental search is a more complex instance of
traditional search interaction because in addition to either stopping or
continuing the search, the user can modify the current search in a
number of ways including specifying a longer (or shorter) search string.

   All of the user commands available during incremental search are
documented in the online Emacs info manual.  These are speech-enabled by
Emacspeak to provide spoken prompts as the dialog begins; auditory icons
indicate a search hit or search miss as the search progresses.  Along
with auditory icons _search-hit_ and _search-miss_ the user also hears
the current line spoken, and in the case of a search hit, the matching
text is _aurally_ highlighted by using the standard audio formatting
technique of changing voice characteristic.  This feedback proves
extremely effective when the search pattern appears several times on a
single line; the user is unambiguously cued to the current match.

   Search and replace actions are an extension to the basic
conversational gestures of a search dialog.  In addition to specifying a
search string, the user also specifies a replacement string.  On the
Emacspeak desktop, this functionality is provided by command
_query-replace_.  The speech-enabled version of this interaction prompts
the user for the search and replacement texts.  The auditory feedback
during the interactive search and replacement process parallels that
described in the case of incremental search.  Audio formatting to
indicate the occurrence that is about to be replaced proves an effective
means of avoiding erroneous modifications to the text being edited.  As
an example, consider using command _query-replace_ to locate and replace
the second occurrence of foo with bar in the text

   ‘Do not change this fool, but change this food.’

   When the search matches the first occurrence of foo in word _fool_,
the aural highlighting helps the user in answering "no" in response to
question "should this occurrence be replaced".  In addition to allowing
the user to supply a simple "yes or no" answer for each match, command
_query-replace_ also allows the user to specify a number of other valid
answers as described in the online Emacs documentation.

Spell Checking
..............

A more complex instance of conversational gesture "search and replace"
is exhibited by standard spell checking dialogues.  Spell checking
differs from the search and replace dialog described above in that the
search and replacement text is guessed by the system based on an
available dictionary.  Words that are not found in the dictionary are
flagged as potential spelling errors, and the system offers an
interactive search and replace dialog for each of these possible errors.
During this dialog, the system successively selects each occurrence of
the possibly erroneous word and offers a set of possible replacements.
Unlike in the case of simple search and replace, more than one possible
replacement string is offered, since a potential spelling error can be
corrected by more than one word appearing in the dictionary.

   In the visual interface, such spell checking dialogues are realized
by displaying the available choices in a pop-up window and allowing the
user to pick a correction Once a correction is selected, the user is
offered the choice of interactively replacing the erroneous word with
the correction.

   The spell checking interface on the Emacspeak desktop is
speech-enabled to provide fluent auditory feedback.  The visual
interface parallels that described above and is provided by package
‘ispell’ which is part of the standard Emacs distribution.  Emacspeak
provides a spoken prompt that is composed of the line containing the
possibly erroneous word (which is aurally highlighted to set it apart
from the rest of the text on that line) and the available corrections.
Each correction is prefixed with a number that the user can use to
select it.  Once a correction is selected, the interaction continues
with the query and replace interaction described earlier.  The speech
interface to the spell checker is as fluent as the visual interface.
Notice that Emacspeak users do not need to concern themselves with the
details of the visual display such as "the corrections are displayed in
a window at the top of the screen".

   In addition to the standard spell checker described above, newer
versions of Emacs include an "on-the-fly" spell checker that flags
erroneous words as they are typed.  Emacspeak speech-enables package
‘flyspell’ so that such erroneous words are aurally highlighted.

10.2 Structured Editing And Templates
=====================================

Editing documents based on the inherent structure present in the
electronic encoding can be very efficient when using spoken interaction.
We described mode _AUCTeX_ -- a specialized interface to authoring LaTeX
documents as a special instance of such structured editing in *note
Document Authoring::.

   The Emacspeak desktop allows the user to efficiently author and
maintain an electronic document based either on the structure present in
the markup (as in the case of mode AUCTeX) or on special outlining
constructs that allow the user to impose a desired logical structure on
the document.  This section describes the effect of speech-enabling such
editing tools and points out the advantages in using these in a speech
oriented interface.

   Template-based authoring -- a technique that allows the user to
create a document by inserting contents into appropriate positions in a
predefined template -- goes hand in hand with such structured editing.
Finally, structured editing can vastly simplify the creation and
maintenance of structured data, for example, the data present in a UNIX
password file.  Such data files are in fact nothing more than a
collection of database records, where each record (or line) consists of
a set of fields delimited by a special character.  Maintaining such
files without exploiting the underlying structure often tends to be
error prone.  We describe editing modes that can exploit such record
structure to provide a fluent editing interface.  Finally, we outline a
speech-enabled interface to a spreadsheet application as a complex
instance of such structured data editing.

* Maintaining Structured Data::   Structured Data.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Outline Editing,  Next: Template-based Authoring,  Up: Structured Editing

10.2.1 Outline Editing
----------------------

All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs desktop allow
the user to _hide_ or _show_ the contents at the different levels of a
possibly nested tree structure.  Components of this tree structure can
be manipulated as a unit, e.g., entire subtrees can be deleted or
copied.  Outline editing thus provides an efficient means of obtaining
quick overviews of a document.

   The visual interface displays such hidden content as a series of
ellipses following the visible outline heading.  Emacspeak produces
auditory icon _ellipses_ when speaking such outline headings.

   The basic _outline mode_ allows the user to specify the syntax and
level of outline header lines as a regular expression.  This simple
technique can be used to advantage in the structured navigation of large
electronic texts such as those available on the Internet from online
book projects such as project Gutenberg and the Internet Wiretap.  For
example, when this feature is activated while reading the electronic
text of a Shakespearean play, the different acts can be recognized as
separate nodes in the logical structure of the document.  The user can
then hide the document body with a single keystroke, navigate the
outline headings to find a particular act, and have that portion
rendered either visually or aurally.  Hiding an outline level produces
auditory icon _close-object_; exposing a hidden level produces auditory
icon _open-object_.  For details on using mode ‘outline’, see the
relevant section of the online Emacs info manual.

   The basic outline facility described above is applicable to all
content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.  In addition,
Emacspeak has other specialized outline editing modes such as _folding
mode_ that provide extended outlining facilities.  In mode _folding_,
the user can create (possibly nested) _folds_ -- logical containers of
content that are delimited by a special _fold mark_.  The fold mark is
typically a text string that is chosen based on the type of content that
is being manipulated.  Thus, when _folding_ a C~program source file,
fold marks are created from C~comments.  The user can _open_ or _close_
any or all folds in a document, and these actions are accompanied by
auditory icons _open-object_ and _close-object_.  By entering a fold,
all editing actions are restricted to the contents of that fold; this
proves a simple yet convenient way of constraining editing actions such
as search and replace to specific portions of large documents.  Folds
can be manipulated as a unit and can be deleted, copied or moved.

   Mode _folding_ proves especially effective in maintaining large
software modules.  The technique can be used to advantage by creating
folds for different sections in a module and by further placing each
function appearing in a particular section in a fold of its own.
Complex functions can themselves be folded into sections where each
section reflects a different stage in the algorithm implemented by that
function.  Thus, the technique of folding can be used as an effective
aid in _literate_ programming.  I typically write software modules by
first creating an outline structure using folds that reflect the various
components of that module.  Next, I populate each fold with the function
signatures and documentation for the functions in each section.  When I
am satisfied with the overall architecture of the module, I fill in the
function skeletons with actual program code.  This technique is used
extensively in maintaining the Emacspeak code base.

10.2.2 Template-based Authoring
-------------------------------

Emacspeak supports two powerful template-based authoring subsystems that
enable the user to quickly create and fill in templates.  _Dmacro_
(short for "dynamic macros") allows the user to define and invoke
template-based macros that are specialized for creating different types
of content.  For example, when programming in C, the user can invoke
dynamic macros that insert skeletons of standard C constructs with a few
keystrokes.  This form of editing has numerous advantages in creating
consistently structured code when developing large software modules.
Emacspeak speech-enables mode _dmacro_ to provide succinct spoken
feedback as templates are created and filled.  The user invokes _
dmacro_ via command _insert dmacro_, which is typically bound to a
single key.  This results in a dialog where the user is prompted to pick
one of the dynamic macros available in the current context.  If the
users choice can be uniquely completed, that completion is spoken;
otherwise, the list of possible completions based on the available
partial input is spoken, accompanied by auditory icon _help_.

   An alternative template-editing facility is provided by mode _tempo_
This mode is designed to be used in creating template-based editing
tools for specific markup languages; a good example is mode
_html-helper_, a mode for creating and updating HTML documents for
publishing on the WWW (see *note Document Authoring::).


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Maintaining Structured Data,  Prev: Template-based Authoring,  Up: Structured Editing

10.2.3 Maintaining Structured Data
----------------------------------

Consider the following entry from file ‘/etc/passwd’ on my laptop.

   ‘aster:KoUxwQ2:501:100:Aster Labrador:/home/aster:/bin/bash’

   File ‘/etc/passwd’ is a simple instance of a text file that stores
structured data records as a series of fields delimited by a special
character.  Each item in the file acquires _meaning_ from the _position_
in which it occurs for example, the fifth field contains the user name,
Aster Labrador.  More generally, structured data where each field in a
record has _ meaning_ is found throughout the desktop in applications
ranging from entries in a rolodex to rows in a spreadsheet.

   Typically, users do not directly edit the stored representation of
the data.  Instead, application front-ends provide a more human-centric
(and hopefully less error prone) user interface for modifying and
maintaining the data.  Thus, spreadsheet applications present the data
as a two dimensional table that is automatically updated to reflect
changes in the underlying data.  The two dimensional table is perhaps
the most commonly found visual front-end to structured data tables with
row and column headers prove a succinct way of implicitly displaying the
_meaning_ along with the _value_ of the fields making up each data
record.

content that is read-only e.g., online documentation.

and in *Note emacspeak-eww::.  For Emacs 24.4 and later, note that the
built-in Web browser EWW is also the browser of choice for emacspeak.
Finally, note that Emacs/W3 is now considered obsolete, and Emacspeak
support for w3m is no longer maintained.

10.4.1 Intro
------------

Web browsing in emacspeak can be made as simple or as complicated as you
wish to make it.  On the one hand, all that need be done is to open a
web browser and fetch a particular url.  This works fine in many cases
with exceptions being things like html tables.  On the other hand, if
you spend a little time learning a particular browser and its
functionality, web browsing can be made more efficient and the web more
navigable.

   This document is intended to be an introduction to the 2 primary
browsers that run under emacs: emacs/w3 and EWW. I also intend to
introduce a couple of add-on packages intended to make life easier and
to address specific shortcomings.

   The primary reason for this documentation is the fact that a lot of
the documentation of the various functions tells exactly what it does,
but not why or in what circumstance one might use it.  Hopefully I can
remedy that here.

Who this document is intended for
=================================

While this document is geared toward emacspeak users, it might be
helpful for other users as well.  I have tried to note where functions
are specific to emacspeak.

Assumptions
===========

This document assumes emacs is installed.  If reading the section on a
particular browser and trying out the associated functions, it, of
course, assumes that the browser is installed and working.  For features
specific to emacspeak, a working install of emacspeak is necessary.  It
is far beyond the scope of this document to help with the installation
of these programs.

   For help with installing any of the above bits of software, the
following mailing lists and / or newsgroups are available:

   • emacs - ‘gnu.emacs.help’

   • emacs/w3 - the mailing list for w3 is pretty dead.  Sorry.  The
     documentation is, however, not terrible.

   • emacspeak - see <http://emacspeak.sf.net>

   It is highly suggested that the mailing list archives, google, and
the relevant documentation be consulted before posting messages to any
mailing list.  Nothing is more irritating than answering the same
questions over and over.  Those of you with kids know what I am talking
about.

   It is also assumed that the reader is comfortable with using emacs
itself.  Understanding the convention for communicating keystrokes to
run commands, navigating documents, and the like are not covered.

10.4.2 emacs-w3
---------------

emacs/w3 is a web browser (now obsolete and replaced by EWW) written
completely in emacs lisp.  It has some really nice features applicable
to the emacspeak community such as the ability to navigate tables and
support for the w3c's aural cascading stylesheets.

emacs/w3 advantages
===================

As mentioned above, the ability to navigate tables is a super help.
emacs/w3 also has support for cascading stylesheets.  This allows
incredible control of voices used for what would normally be visual
attributes of the text such as bold, italics, preformatted text and the
like.

   Another advantage of emacs/w3 is that it is written completely in
emacs lisp.  With some effort, emacs/w3 is very customizable and quite
extendable.

emacs/w3 disadvantages
======================

Rendering can be slow.  Sometimes it can be painfully, excruciatingly
slow.  That might be a slight exaggeration, but slow it is.  This is
because it is written in lisp...  something I mentioned just above as a
strength.  It is a trade-off, but one that some see as worth it.  There
are, however, some things that can be done to speed up the browsing
process.  See *Note ‘emacspeak-w3-xsl-transform’: xsl-transform, for
more information.

   Another disadvantage is that emacs/w3 chokes on some pages.
Sometimes it gives error messages and doesn't display anything.
Sometimes it does this to some people and doesn't do it to others as we
saw on the emacspeak mailing list a short time ago.  Sometimes it gives
error messages and renders the page anyway.

   One other major annoyance of emacs/w3 is that sometimes it simply
stops doing anything while rendering a page.  There is a way I have
found to get around this.  I hit ‘C-g’.  I usually wait five to ten
seconds and then simply quit, using ‘C-g’.  Not always, but usually, the
page has already completed downloading and is being rendered and it
therefore is not a problem.

   emacs/w3 also has no bookmark functionality.  This can be remedied in
several ways.  One simple way, mentioned below, is to use the emacs
package bmk-mgr.  Another way is to use org mode with remember which is
the method used by Dr.  Raman, the author of emacspeak.  See *Note
bmk-mgr: bmk-mgr, later in this manual, for more information.

   History back and next in the browser also seem to be broken but this
is not generally a problem for me as I never look back.

emacs/w3 native functions
=========================

Many functions for efficient navigation of the internet are native to
emacs/w3.  Some of the most useful functions are listed below

   Unlike emacs-w3m, the information presented by ‘describe-mode’ is
very complete, but a little terse.  All the function names are listed
and asking for help on particular functions works well.  That being
said, use this list to augment, not replace, the built-in help that is
available in emacs.

   ‘C-f’ will open a new buffer containing the cell point is in.  In
most instances, this works very well.  Imagine you are looking at a page
that is divided into 4 distinct areas: a cell at the top of the page
that contains a banner and some navigation, and a "body" area that is
divided into three sections consisting of more navigation, an article,
and advertisement.  If point is in the main article cell, using ‘C-f’
will open another buffer that contains only the text of that cell, the
article you are interested in.

   One caveat is that this does not always work as advertised.
Sometimes the leftmost character of each line is missing.  At least it
makes for interesting reading.  Usually when I have this problem I
simply exit that buffer and linearize the tables in the original page.

   The ‘m’ key executes a very useful command.  It will complete a link
on the page.  Imagine that you are reading through a document and you
hear a link that you need to visit.  You could tab through all the links
until you hear the one you want or you could hit the ‘m’ key and enter
the link text at the prompt.  Completion is available and it is not
case-sensitive.  Efficient, no?

   The period in a cell will speak the contents of that particular cell.
This command is, in my opinion, most useful when navigating tables with
cells that have only one paragraph or less.  I tend to not read whole
articles in this manner because, inevitably, someone will interrupt me
and I will lose my place.

   The equals key, while in a table cell will give you the cell
information.  It tells you the row and column position, the size of the
table, and at what nesting level the table is.

   The pipe key, is used to read the table column.  As this command
seems to read the rectangle the column is in, this command is most
useful when used in a table where there is no column spanning, i.e.  all
rows and columns are uniform.

   Here is a list of table navigation commands:

   • ‘C-e +’ moves to the beginning of the next table row.

   • ‘C-e -’ moves to the beginning of the previous table row.

   • ‘C-e <’ moves to the beginning of the table.

   • ‘C-e >’ moves to the end of the table.

   • ‘C-e =’ moves to the top of the table column.

   • ‘C-e <DOWN>’ moves to the next cell down in the same column.

   • ‘C-e <UP>’ moves to the previous cell in the same column.

   • ‘C-e <LEFT>’ moves to the previous cell in the same row.

   • ‘C-e <RIGHT>’ moves to the next cell in the same row.

   As you can see, table navigation in w3 can be easy and fun.

emacspeak specific functions for emacs/w3
=========================================

An incredible amount of work has been done by the emacspeak community to
make emacs/w3 accessible to those with visual impairments.  Here is an
explanation of some of those functions.

   The command ‘C-t’ will toggle the visibility of table borders.  This
command might be useful where you want to hear all punctuation symbols
on a page but the table characters get in the way.

   The quote key will execute a command that allows you to skim the
contents of the buffer.  it will read the page, paragraph-by-paragraph,
pausing between paragraphs to prompt you to move on by pressing <SPACE>.
If you hit <SPACE> in the middle of a paragraph, it skips to the next
paragraph.

   Another skimming command is bound to the ‘z’ key.  This will allow
you to zip through web pages by logical blocks such as div, paragraph,
and table tags.

   Using the imenu facilities is another way of skimming the document
and getting to the information you desire.  imenu works especially well
for well-structured documents.  The first thing that need be done is to
copy the ‘w3-imenu.el’ file from the ‘contrib’ directory of the ‘w3’
directory to somewhere in your load path.  I am using the cvs version of
w3 and my w3 directory is under ‘/home/rdc/sourceforge’.  The easiest
thing to do is probably to do an ‘M-x locate’ and search for
‘w3-imenu.el’ to see where it is.  After locating the file, move it into
your load path.  In my case I have it under
‘/home/rdc/share/emacs/site-lisp/’.

   There are two ways to use the imenu facilities: automatically and
manually.  Since I do not use imenu on every site, I prefer to invoke it
manually to save the time required to build the index.

   Once things are in place, invoke imenu with the ‘j’ key.  This will
ask you for an index position.  Hitting <TAB> will give you a list of
the possible index positions.  Another way of navigating the document
would now be to use the keys ‘M-n’ and ‘M-p’ to go to the next and
previous index positions.  Note that you have to build an index for a
page before you can use these commands.

   ‘Cap A’ and ‘cap R’ serve the same function.  ‘Cap A’ browses the
Atom feed at point and ‘cap R’ browses the rss feed at point.  This is
useful to sample the feed, so to speak, before going through the trouble
of configuring your feed reader to fetch the feed.  It might also be
useful to grab the headlines from a page and present them in a more
concise, readable format.  If using the sort-tables xsl transform, there
will be a link at the top of the page if there is an rss feed available.
See *Note emacspeak atom and emacspeak rss: rss, for more information.

   Google provides many useful tools for web surfers.  The following
commands are useful to access much google goodness.

   ‘Cap C’ extracts the current page from the google cache.  With a
prefix argument it will extract the link under point.  This is useful
for those times when a particular site is down...  maybe it is in the
cache...  maybe it is not.  It can also be used for when particular
pages are removed from a site like in the case of a government
conspiracy.  Are we at war with Eurasia or East Asia?

   The slash key will search google for pages similar to the current
page.

   The command ‘g’ will do a google search restricted to the site of the
document.

   The ‘l’ command googles for who links to this page.

   The command ‘t’ runs the url under point through the google
transcoder.  This is useful for sites that are heavy on the use of
tables and the xsl transforms are not helpful.  It also works on some
sites that use javascript to go to the next page in the story, such as
Reuters.  Using a prefix argument with this command will untranscode the
url under point for pages that are currently transcoded.

   ‘Cap T’ will jump to the first occurrence of the title in the
document.  Multiple consecutive executions of this command will jump to
further occurrences.  This command is probably one of the most useful
timesavers while web browsing.

   ‘M-s’ jumps to the "submit" button for the form you are editing.

   ‘M-r’ plays the media stream at point with the default media player.

   The ‘y’ command will rewrite the url of the url under point.  This is
useful for those sites you frequent.  Often, sites that have printer
friendly content have a specific way in which the url is written.  For
The first time you run this command in a particular buffer you are
prompted for a pattern to use.  The pattern is in the form of

   ‘("from string" "to string")’

   The opening paren is supplied.  Remember to quote the strings or you
will get an error.  From this point on, until you kill the buffer in
which you wrote the rule, hitting ‘y’ on a link will use this rewrite
rule to visit the page.  If you mistyped the rule, providing a numeric
argument will allow you to rewrite the rewrite rule.  I love
alliteration.

   Saving the best for last, ‘e’ is the xsl map prefix.  As I mentioned
in the section on emacs-w3m, xsl transforms are some powerful magic that
takes a web page and transforms it in some way.  Linearizing tables is a
good example, and the one I use most often.

   The keystroke ‘e a’ prompts for an xsl transform to apply to the
current page.  If you know the name of the particular transform you want
you can use tab completion to select it.  Otherwise, you can hit <TAB>
to get a buffer that contains the list of choices.

   If you know that you want a particular transform done automatically
you can use the command ‘e s’ to select a transform and then ‘e o’ to
turn xslt on (the same command will turn xslt off).  Then, every page
opened from that point on will have the transform applied.

   There is the variable ‘emacspeak-w3-xsl-transform’ that can be set
via the usual methods.  This variable specifies a transform to use
before displaying a web page.  There is an advantage to turning on xsl
transforms all the time.  If you use the ‘identity.xsl’, the
‘linearize-tables.xsl’ or the ‘sort-tables.xsl’ it can actually speed up
rendering of the page.  This is because the transforms provide clean and
balanced html to the renderer.  Additionally, using ‘sort-tables.xsl’ or
‘linearize-tables.xsl’ will provide a little more boost as rendering
nested tables is particularly difficult for a web browser.

   Sometimes it is just easier to read the printer friendly version of a
story instead of having to linearize the tables and search for the
content.  Also, some sites, like the New York Times, I believe, make you
navigate several pages to read the whole story, but if you select a
"Print this story" link you can read the entire story on one page
formatted without a lot of the cruft on the normal page.  This is where
the ‘e Cap P’ command comes in.  It will extract all the print streams
from the current document.

   Closely associated commands are ‘e r’ and ‘e Cap R’ which extract the
media streams from the current page and from the link under point,
respectively.

   The command ‘e y’ is another command that is useful for frequented
sites.  It does the same as the ‘y’ command above in that it rewrites
the url at point and follows it.  In addition, it filters the output by
a particular CSS class.

   The command ‘e e’ does more magic to the url at point.  It processes
the url using a specific function.  For example, it can be used in
retrieving radio content from the BBC. If you execute ‘C-e u’ and type
in ‘BBC Channel On Demand’ or use tab completion to get the same, and
then type in ‘radio4’ you will be presented with a page containing a
plethora of links to other pages containing information about particular
shows.  On these pages there is, somewhere, a link that will play the
program.  If you hit enter on one of the links on the first page, you
will be taken to one of these description pages.  By using the ‘e e’
command on a link you cut out this middle step and proceed directly to
playing the program you are interested in.

   If there is no executor defined for a current buffer, hitting <TAB>
after ‘e e’ will give you a list of possibilities to choose from.  One
nice feature of this function is that it can be used for any function.
If you cannot remember the keystroke that will play the url under point
in ‘emacspeak-m-player’, but you know what it is called, you can hit ‘e
e’ and then enter the name of the function.  Nice.

   The ‘e f’ command will run the current page through an XPath filter
and return the results.  For more information on XPath, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath>.  If you wanted to see only the
links on a page, when prompted enter ‘//a’ and you will be returned
every link on the page.  If you wanted to see only the contents of "p"
tags, you would enter ‘//p’.  This can be useful for many things, form
elements included.  Giving this command a prefix argument will reverse
the filter, giving you everything but the content of the specified tag.

   A related command can be invoked with the ‘e p’ keystroke.  This
command does the same as the filter above but works on the url under
point.

emacs/w3 tips and tricks
========================

As I mentioned above, using ‘C-g’ when it seems the browser is not
responding will often display the page with no ill effects.  Your
mileage may vary.  Taxes, tags and title are extra.

   Also mentioned above is the use of sort-tables or identity as an xsl
transform to speed up the rendering of pages.  Every little bit helps.

   Another useful tip is the use of the ‘k’ key.  This key will place
the current url in the kill-ring for later yanking.  If a page will not
render correctly, using ‘k’ will get the url and allow me to pass it to
emacs-w3m.  The counterpart to this command, ‘cap K’ puts the url under
point in the kill-ring.

10.4.3 Add-ons
--------------

Some of these are emacspeak specific, some are not.  You can usually
tell by the name.

emacspeak url template
======================

I love this package.  Since changing my primary browser to emacs/w3 I
have really been giving the ‘url-template’ package a workout.  The
‘url-template’ package contains templates that prompt you for
information to supply to various sites to retrieve information without
all the fuss of having to go to the site and navigate it.  One really
nice thing about url-templates is the fact that they need not be web
pages.  Media streams can also be made into url-templates.

   The way to get to the templates is with the command ‘C-e u’.  A <TAB>
at the prompt will give you a list of the available templates.  You
should go now and have a look at the info manual section on *Note URL
Templates: URL Templates, and read it.  I'll wait here.

   By the way, the ones I find most useful are the "Google Hits",
"emacswiki search" "NPR On Demand" and "Weather forecast from Weather
Underground".

emacspeak atom and emacspeak rss
================================

These are fairly simple rss and atom browsers for the emacspeak desktop.
Using the Customize interface you add feeds in the form of titles and
urls.  Then you call the readers with ‘C-e C-u’ for rss feeds and use
‘M-x emacspeak-atom-browse’ for atom feeds.  There is also emacspeak
support for newsticker, an rss / atom reader that is a part of emacs 22,
but I have never used it.

   I personally use *Note gnus: Top, for rss feeds but setting gnus up
for only that purpose is like hunting rabbits with a bazooka.

emacspeak websearch
===================

‘emacspeak-websearch’ provides more search options than you can shake a
stick at; ‘emacspeak-websearch’ provides search for dictionaries, news
sites, software sites, google tools, weather, currency converter and
much more.  It can be accessed with the keystroke ‘C-e ?’.  At the
prompt, you can enter another question mark to get a list of the
available search options.  You will then be prompted for the necessary
information.  One of the nice things about this package is that it
attempts to jump to and read the most relevant information on the result
page.  Module ‘emacspeak-websearch’ is complemented by module
‘emacspeak-url-template’; that module provides URL templates that prompt
for and retrieve the relevant information from complex Web pages.

   *Note emacspeak-websearch: emacspeak-websearch, and *Note
emacspeak-url-template: emacspeak-url-template, for more information.

bmk-mgr
=======

This is a newcomer to the emacspeak world.  In the interest of full
disclosure, I am the one that wrote the emacspeak module that makes this
package accessible.  It is a bookmarks manager that works with both
emacs/w3 and emacs-w3m.  As of the writing of this document there are
still some issues, especially when using it on emacs version 22, but
those are being worked on.  I think this is a good solution to the
problem of emacs/w3 not having bookmarks functionality and providing one
central bookmark location for those who regularly use both browsers.
See <http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsBmkMgr>, for more
information.

10.4.4 Conclusion
-----------------

emacspeak makes the internet not only accessible to those with visual
impairments, but it makes browsing and information retrieval quick and
efficient.  If a user will spend a little time up front to learn the
tools available to access the web, the increase in efficiency and
ability will more than make up for the time spent.  The nice thing about
these tools is that you can integrate them in your day-to-day as you
have the time.  While it is not necessary to use everything mentioned in
the above document, if you add some of these tools to your repertoire
you will not be sorry.

   In the end, no one makes you use a hammer to drive nails but it sure
beats using a banana.

10.5 Messaging
==============

Working with messaging applications involves both authoring and browsing
content.  Emacspeak provides a rich set of speech-enabled messaging
tools.  Further, all of the tools described in the previous sections
integrate smoothly with the messaging applications described here; this
means that you do not need to re-learn a new set of work habits when
dealing with content in your messaging application.

10.6 Editing Code
=================

Files containing program source code form a very specific class of
structured documents.  Unlike documents meant for human consumption that
are often only loosely structured, program source (as a concession to
the computer's intolerance of lack of structure) are per force
well-structured and adhere to a fairly stringent syntax.

   The Emacs environment provides editing modes that are specific to
creating and maintaining software written in most popular programming
languages.  Many of these editing modes are speech-enabled by Emacspeak.
Speech-enabling these modes includes providing a rich set of
navigational commands that allow you to move through the source
efficiently.  In addition, Emacspeak's core voice-lock facilities are
used to produce audio formatted output -- this helps you spot errors
quickly.

10.7 Development Environment
============================

In addition to providing specialized editing modes for creating and
maintaining program source, Emacs provides a rich set of software
development tools that can be combined to create powerful Integrated
Development Environments (IDE).  These IDEs are speech-enabled by
Emacspeak to provide a versatile and powerful environment for eyes-free
software development.

10.8 Desktop Management
=======================

Emacs provides an integrated environment for performing all of ones
day-to-day computing tasks ranging from electronic messaging to software
development.  The environment derives its power from the fact that this
integration allows for content to be handled across different tasks in a
seamless manner.  In order to work effectively with large Emacs sessions
with many documents and applications open at the same time, the
Emacspeak desktop provides a powerful collection of desktop management
tools designed to help the user easily locate objects that pertain to a
given task.

10.9 Personal Information Management
====================================

This section describes speech-enabled tools designed to aid in personal
information management such as maintaining a daily calendar.


File: emacspeak.info,  Node: Desktop Applications,  Prev: Personal Information Management,  Up: Emacs Packages

10.10 Desktop Applications
==========================

10.10.1 Spread Sheets
---------------------

Spreadsheet applications present a two dimensional view of structured
data where the field values are (possibly) mutually dependent.  On the
Emacspeak desktop, a speech-enabled spreadsheet application can be used
to manipulate such data-driven documents ranging from simple cheque
books and expense reports to complex investment portfolios.  Where the
traditional visual interface to spreadsheets is typically independent of
the semantics of the data stored in the spreadsheet, the speech-enabled
interface is derived from the _meaning_ of the various fields making up
the data.  When presenting such information on a visual display,
implicit visual layout can be used to cue the user to the meaning of
different data fields.

   On the other hand, in the case of an actively scrolling auditory
display, the spoken output needs to explicitly convey both the value and
interpretation of the different data items.  In addition, the interface
needs to enable an active dialog between user and application where the
user is able to query the system about the possible meaning of a
particular item of data.

   Finally, the aural interface needs to enable _multiple_ views of the
display.  In the visual interface, such _multiple_ views are
automatically enabled by the two dimensional layout combined with the
eye's ability to move rapidly around the layout structure.  Thus, while
viewing any particular row of a portfolio, one can immediately see the
current total value as well as the net gain or loss.  The Emacs
spread-sheet package ‘dismal’ can be retrieved from
<ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/local/fox/dismal>.

10.10.2 Forms Mode
------------------

_Forms_ mode an Emacs mode designed to edit structured data records like
the line shown from file ‘/etc/passwd’ presents a user-friendly visual
interface that displays the field name along with the field value.  The
user can edit the field value and save the file, at which point the data
is written out using the underlying ‘ :’ delimited representation.  Mode
_forms_ provides a flexible interface to associating meaning to the
fields of such structured data files.  For details on it use, see the
forms-mode section of the online Emacs info documentation.

10.10.3 OCR -- Reading Print Documents
--------------------------------------

Module ‘emacspeak-ocr’ implements an OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

   Page image is acquired using tools from package ‘SANE’ (Scanner
Access Now Easy).  The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if
one is available, and the results placed in a buffer that is suitable
for browsing the results.  This buffer is placed in mode
‘emacspeak-ocr-mode’ a specialized mode for reading and scanning
documents.

10.10.3.1 Emacspeak OCR Mode
............................

Emacspeak OCR mode is a special major mode for document scanning and
OCR.

   Pre-requisites:

   • A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

   • An OCR engine.

   Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have the
utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a tiff file.  Then
set variable EMACSPEAK-OCR-SCAN-IMAGE-PROGRAM to point at this utility.
By default, this is set to 'scanimage' which is the image scanning
utility provided by SANE.

   By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired tiff
image; make sure you have a utility like ‘tiffcp’.  Variable
EMACSPEAK-OCR-COMPRESS-IMAGE is set to 'tiffcp' by default; if you use
something else, you should customize this variable.

   Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and working.  By
default this front-end assumes that OCR is available as ‘/usr/bin/ocr’.

   Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying OCR to it
work independently of Emacs, you can use this Emacspeak front-end to
enable easy OCR access from within Emacspeak.

   The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command “emacspeak-ocr”
bound to ‘C-e C-o’.

   This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR commands
bounds to single keystrokes -- see the key-binding list at the end of
this description.  Use Emacs online help facility to look up help on
these commands.

   Mode “emacspeak-ocr-mode” provides the necessary functionality to
scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned images and the
resulting text are saved under directory ‘~/ocr’; see variable
EMACSPEAK-OCR-WORKING-DIRECTORY.  Invoking command
“emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory” bound to ‘d’ will open this
directory.

   By default, the document being scanned is named 'untitled'.  You can
name the document by using command “emacspeak-ocr-name-document” bound
to ‘n’.  The document name is used in constructing the name of the image
and text files.

   Here is a list of all emacspeak OCR commands along with their
key-bindings and a brief description:

‘digit’
     “emacspeak-ocr-page” Jumps to specified page in the OCR output.

‘c’
     “emacspeak-ocr-set-compress-image-options” Interactively update
     image compression options.  Prompts with current setting in the
     minibuffer.  Setting persists for current Emacs session.

‘i’
     “emacspeak-ocr-set-scan-image-options” Interactively update scan
     image options.  Prompts with current setting in the minibuffer.
     Setting persists for current Emacs session.

‘spc’
     “emacspeak-ocr-read-current-page” Speaks current page.

‘s’
     “emacspeak-ocr-save-current-page” Saves current page as a text
     file.

‘p’
     “emacspeak-ocr-page” Prompts for a page number and moves to the
     specified page.

‘]’
     “emacspeak-ocr-forward-page” Move forward to the next page.

‘[’
     “emacspeak-ocr-backward-page” Move back to the previous page.

     “emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory” Open directory containing
     the results of OCR.

‘n’
     “emacspeak-ocr-name-document” Name current document.

‘o’
     “emacspeak-ocr-recognize-image” Launch OCR engine on a scanned
     image.

‘i’
     “emacspeak-ocr-scan-image” Acquire an image using ‘scanimage’.

‘RET’
     “emacspeak-ocr-scan-and-recognize” Scan and recognize a page.

12 Emacspeak Commands And Options
*********************************

Overview
========

This chapter documents the various Emacspeak modules and is
auto-generated from the Emacspeak source code.  It is meant to be a
complete reference to the emacspeak implementation while also providing
high-level usage summaries of some of the larger Emacspeak modules.

   Each section provides a high-level overview of that module, followed
by detailed description of the commands and options defined in that
module.

   Emacspeak modules can be classified as follows:
  1. Modules that interface with various TTS engines, e.g.
     ‘espeak-voices’ and ‘dectalk-voices’.

  2. Modules that implement core Emacspeak functionality, e.g.,
     ‘emacspeak-speak’, ‘emacspeak-keymap’, ‘voice-lock’ and
     ‘emacspeak-advice’.

  3. Emacspeak extensions that speech-enable various emacs packages,
     these are all named using the convention ‘emacspeak-<PACKAGENAME>’.

   The first two of the above are mostly of interest when extending
Emacspeak, or to learn how things are implemented.  The third category
is useful in understanding how emacspeak works with a given package;
thus, when learning to use the Emacs Web Browser (EWW), read the *Note
(emacs)EWW:: documentation, then *Note emacspeak-eww::.

   This chapter documents a total of 1155 commands and 146 options.

12.1 amixer
===========

Provide an emacs front-end to amixer, the sound mixer in ALSA that is
used to configure the audio device.

   The main entry point is command ‘emacspeak-audio-setup’ bound to
‘C-e)’.  When called for the first time, this command builds up a
database of available controls on the default audio device.  These
control names are then available for completion in the minibuffer.  Pick
a desired control, e.g., "master playback volume", and this displays a
prompt with the current value.  Enter the new value and press <RETURN>.
To reset all controls to their default values, Press ‘C-j’.

12.9 emacspeak-advice
=====================

This module defines the advice forms for making the core of Emacs speak
Advice forms that are specific to Emacs subsystems do not belong here!
I violate this at present by advising completion.  Note that we needed
to advice a lot more for Emacs 19 and Emacs 20 than we do for Emacs 21
and Emacs 22.  As of August 2007, this file is being purged of advice
forms not needed in Emacs 22.

12.10 emacspeak-amark
=====================

Structure emacspeak-amark holds a bookmark into an mp3 file path:
filename containing marked name: Bookmark tag Position: time offset from
start

   This library will be used from emacspeak-m-player to set and jump to
bookmarks.  Amarks are stored in a .amarks.am file in the working
directory.  It also provides a simple AMark Browser to use from a
directory containing mp3 files where Amarks have been created - see
‘emacspeak-amarks-browse’.  ‘emacspeak-amarks-bookshelf’ brings up a
_AmarksBookshelf_ that can be used to browse available Amark files.

12.10.1 Emacspeak-Amark Commands

12.10.1.1 emacspeak-amark-add
.............................

 -- Command: emacspeak-amark-add (path name position)

     Add an AMark to the buffer local list of AMarks. AMarks are
     bookmarks in audio content. If there is an existing amark of the

     Optional interactive prefix arg prompts for a pattern that is
     used to filter the amarks files to show.  Use
     M-x emacspeak-dired-open-this-file to open the AMark Browser on
     current file.

     (fn &optional PATTERN)

       M-x emacspeak-m-player as is usual when that command is called
       while media is already playing. Here, attempting to play the next
       item while the current item is playing produces the prompt.

     first time.
   • The password will be saved to your configured ‘auth-source’ --
     usually ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’.  You can also use ‘password-store[.]’
   • The results of the search appear in the Bookshare buffer.  Audio
     formatting and auditory icons convey if a result is already
     available locally.
   • If not available locally, press ‘D’ to download the content.
   • Press ‘U’ to unpack the downloaded content.

12.28 emacspeak-chess
=====================

The Emacs Chess package provides a rich environment for playing and
exploring Chess Games.  That package comes with a light-weight module
that announces moves.

   This module aims to do much more, including:
   • Navigate the board along various axes with audio-formatted output.
   • Browse games via rich audio-formatted output.
   • Speech-enable all interactive commands provided by the Chess
     package.
   • Enable various means of exploring the state of game, perhaps with a
     view to being able to spot patterns from listening to the output.

12.28.1 Navigating And Examining The Board
------------------------------------------

The board can be navigated along the 8 compass directions.  Arrow keys
move to the appropriate squares on the board.  ‘/’ and ‘\’ move down the
diagonals.  ‘[’ and ‘]’ move up the respective diagonals.
   • Move North: ‘emacspeak-chess-north’ bound to ‘up’.
   • Move South: ‘emacspeak-chess-south’ bound to ‘down’.
   • Move West: ‘emacspeak-chess-west’ bound to ‘left’.
   • Move East: ‘emacspeak-chess-east’ bound to ‘right’.
   You can also move along the diagonals:
   • Move Northwest: ‘emacspeak-chess-northwest’ bound to ‘[’.
   • Move Northeast: ‘emacspeak-chess-northeast’ bound to ‘]’.
   • Move Southwest: ‘emacspeak-chess-southwest’ bound to ‘/’.
   • Move Southeast: ‘emacspeak-chess-southeast’ bound to ‘\’.
   You can also jump to a given board position by:
   • Jump: ‘emacspeak-chess-jump’ bound to ‘j’.
   • Target of last move: ‘emacspeak-chess-goto-target’ bound to ‘t’.
   • Look: ‘emacspeak-chess-speak-that-square’ bound to ‘l’.
   • Review current square: ‘;’.
   • Review Board: ‘emacspeak-chess-speak-board’ bound to ‘z’.  Useful
     in end-state.
   • Locate pieces: ‘emacspeak-chess-speak-piece-squares’ bound to ‘s’.
     Specify piece as a single char -- ‘w’ speaks all white pieces, ‘l’
     speaks all black pieces, use SAN notation char for a specific
     piece.  Use ‘a’ to hear entire board, this last is most useful when
     the game is an end-state.
   • Discover who targets a square: ‘emacspeak-chess-speak-who-targets’
     bound to ‘w’.  Argument ‘piece’ is similar to the previously listed
     command.
   You can obtain views of the board along the rows and diagonals, as
well as a _knight's perspective _:
   • Viewers: ‘v’ followed by the directional navigation keys speaks the
     squares in that direction from the current square.  ‘vn’ speaks the
     squares from a knight's perspective, i.e.  the squares the Knight
     would see from the current position.  similarly, ‘vk’ speaks the
     non-empty squares seen by the King from the current position.  ‘v’
     followed by a rank-or-file char speaks that complete rank or file.

12.28.2 Examining Games
-----------------------

Package _Chess_ allows one to browse through a game using ‘,’ and ‘.’ --
‘chess-display-move-backward’ and ‘chess-display-move-forward’.
Emacspeak speech-enables these commands to speak the move that led to
the currently displayed state of the game.  Finally, ‘m’ speaks the
_current move_ being displayed.

====================

Loading this module sets up Emacspeak to respond to DBus notifications.
This module needs to be loaded explicitly from the user's init file
after emacspeak has been started.

12.39.1 Overview
----------------

This module provides integration via DBus for the following:
   • Respond to network coming up or going down -- ‘(nm-enable)’.
   • Respond to screen getting locked/unlocked by gnome-screen-saver --
     ‘(emacspeak-dbus-watch-screen-lock)’.
   • Respond to laptop going to sleep or waking up --
     ‘(emacspeak-dbus-sleep-enable)’.
   • Respond to insertion/ejection of removable storage --
     ‘(emacspeak-dbus-udisks-enable)’.
   • Watch for power devices -- ‘(emacspeak-dbus-upower-enable)’.
   • An interactive command ‘emacspeak-dbus-lock-screen’ bound to ‘C-,
     C-d’ to lock the screen using DBus.  Note: this key-binding is
     available only if this module is loaded.
   Add calls to the desired functions from the above list to the emacs
startup file after this module has been loaded.  See relevant hooks for
customizing behavior.  Note that each of the sleep/wake-up, UDisks2 and
network/up-down can be separately enabled/disabled, and the actions
customized via appropriately named hook functions.

12.51 emacspeak-ediff
=====================

Ediff provides a nice visual interface to diff.  ;;;Comparing and
patching files is easy with ediff when you can see the screen.  This
module provides Emacspeak extensions to work fluently with ediff.  Try
it out, it's an excellent example of why Emacspeak is better than a
traditional screenreader.  This module was originally written to
interface to the old ediff.el bundled with GNU Emacs 19.28 and earlier.
It has been updated to work with the newer and much larger ediff system
found in Emacs 19.29 and later.

   When using under modern versions of Emacs, I recommend setting (setq
ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain) so that Emacs
always displays Ediff windows in a single frame.

12.67 emacspeak-epub
====================

12.67.1 Introduction
--------------------

This module implements the Emacspeak EPub Bookshelf -- a unified
interface for organizing, locating and reading EPub EBooks on the
emacspeak Audio Desktop.  The epub reader is built using the Emacs Web
Browser (EWW), and all of emacspeak's EWW conveniences are available
when reading EBooks -- see *Note emacspeak-eww:: for useful tools
including bookmarking and structured navigation.  For now it supports
epub2 -- it will support epub3 some time in the future.

   The main entry point is command ‘emacspeak-epub’ bound to ‘C-e g’.
This command opens a new bookshelf buffer unless the user has previously
opened a specific bookshelf.  A _bookshelf_ is a buffer that lists books
placed on a given bookshelf -- these are listed by _title_ and _author_.
The bookshelf buffer is in a special mode that provides single-key
commands for adding, removing and finding books, as well as for opening
the selected book using Emacs' built-in Web browser (‘eww’).

   The next few sections give a high-level overview of the emacspeak
Bookshelf and EPub interaction, followed by detailed documentation on
the various commands and user options.

12.67.2 Organizing EBooks On The Emacspeak Desktop
--------------------------------------------------

In the simplest case, EBooks can be placed under a specific directory
(with sub-directories as needed).  Customize user option
‘emacspeak-epub-library-directory’ to point to this location.  Here is a
quick summary of commands for organizing, saving and opening a
bookshelf:

‘a’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-add-epub
‘b’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-open
‘c’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-clear
‘d’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-remove-this-book
‘r’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-rename
‘l’
     emacspeak-epub-locate-epubs
‘C-a’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-add-directory
‘C-d’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-remove-directory
‘C-l’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-redraw
‘C-o’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-open-epub
‘M-s’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-save
‘C-x C-q’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-refresh
‘C-x C-s’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-save

12.67.3 Integrating With Project Gutenberg
------------------------------------------

Gutenberg integration provides one-shot commands for downloading the
latest copy of the Gutenberg catalog and finding and downloading the
desired epub for offline reading.

‘C’
     emacspeak-epub-gutenberg-catalog
‘g’
     emacspeak-epub-gutenberg-download
   Once downloaded, these EBooks can be organized under
‘emacspeak-epub-library-directory’ For more advanced usage, see the next
section on integrating with Calibre catalogs.

12.67.4 Calibre Integration
---------------------------

Project Calibre enables the indexing and searching of large EBook
collections.  Read the Calibre documentation for organizing and indexing
your EBook library.  See user options named ‘emacspeak-epub-calibre-*’
for customizing emacspeak to work with Calibre.  Once set up, Calibre
integration provides the following commands from the _bookshelf_ buffer:

‘/’
     emacspeak-epub-calibre-results
‘A’
     emacspeak-epub-bookshelf-calibre-author
‘S’

12.67.5 Reading EBooks From The Bookshelf
-----------------------------------------

The most efficient means to read an EBook is to have EWW render the
entire book -- this works well even for very large EBooks given that EWW
is efficient at rendering HTML. Rendering the entire book means that all
of the contents are available for searching.  To view an EBook in its
entirety, use command ‘emacspeak-epub-eww’.  You can open the EPub table
of contents with command ‘emacspeak-epub-open’; for a well-constructed
epub, this TOC should provide hyperlinks to each section listed in the
table of contents.

12.75 emacspeak-eww
===================

EWW == Emacs Web Browser EWW is a light-weight Web browser built into
Emacs starting with Emacs-24.4 .  This module speech-enables EWW.

   It implements additional interactive commands for navigating the DOM.
It also provides a set of filters for interactively filtering the DOM by
various attributes such as id, class and role.  Finally, this module
updates EWW's built-in key-bindings with Emacspeak conveniences.

12.75.1 Structured Navigation
-----------------------------

These commands move through section headers as defined in HTML.
‘1’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-h1’ Move to next ‘H1’ heading.
‘2’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-h2’ Move to next ‘H2’ heading.
‘3’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-h3’ Move to next ‘H3’ heading.
‘4’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-h4’ Move to next ‘H4’ heading.
‘.’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-h’ Move to next heading.  (‘H1’...‘H4’).
‘M-1’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-h1’ Move to previous ‘H1’ heading.
‘M-2’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-h2’ Move to previous ‘H2’ heading.
‘M-3’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-h3’ Move to previous ‘H3’ heading.
‘M-4’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-h4’ Move to previous ‘H4’ heading.
‘,’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-h’ Move to previous heading (‘H1’...‘H4’).

   This next set of DOM commands enable navigating by HTML elements.
‘M-SPC’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-speak-this-element’ Speak contents of current
     element.
‘J’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-element-like-this’ Jump to next element that is
     the same as the one under point.  If there are multiple HTML
     elements under point, prompts for element-name using completion.
‘K’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-element-like-this’ Jump to previous element
     that is the same as the one under point.  If there are multiple
     HTML elements under point, prompts for element-name using
     completion.
‘N’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-element-from-history’ Jump to next element
     based on previous J/K command history.
‘P’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-element-from-history’ Jump to previous
     element based on previous J/K history.
‘O’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-li’ Jump to previous list item.
‘o’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-li’ Jump to next list item.
‘T’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-table’ Jump to previous table in page.
‘t’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-table’ Jump to next table.
‘[’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-p’ Jump to previous paragraph.
‘]’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-p’ Jump to next paragraph.
‘b’
     ‘shr-previous-link’ Jump to previous link.
‘f’
     ‘shr-next-link’ Jump to next link.
‘n’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-next-element’ Jump to next element.
‘p’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-previous-element’ Jump to previous element.
‘s’
     ‘eww-readable’ Use EWW's built-in readable tool.
‘:’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-tags-at-point’ Display currently active HTML tags at
     point.

12.75.2 Filtering Content Using The DOM
---------------------------------------

These commands use EWW's HTML DOM to display different filtered views of
the Web page.  With an interactive prefix argument, these commands
prompt for a list of filters.  Command ‘emacspeak-eww-restore’ bound to
‘DEL’ can be used to restore the previous view.

‘A’
     ‘eww-view-dom-having-attribute’ Display DOM nodes having specified
     attribute.  Valid attributes are available via completion.
‘C’
     ‘eww-view-dom-having-class’ Display DOM nodes having specified
     class.  Valid classes are available via completion.
‘E’
     ‘eww-view-dom-having-elements’ Display specified elements from the
     Dom.  Valid element names are available via completion.
‘I’
     ‘eww-view-dom-having-id’ Display DOM nodes having specified ID.
     Valid id values are available via completion.

‘M’
     ‘eww-view-dom-element-having-text’ lines containing pattern.
     Useful to filter down RSS feeds.
‘R’
     ‘eww-view-dom-having-role’ Display DOM nodes having specified role.
     Valid roles are available via completion.
‘M-a’
     ‘eww-view-dom-not-having-attribute’ Filter out DOM nodes having
     specified attribute.  Valid attribute values are available via
     completion.
‘M-c’
     ‘eww-view-dom-not-having-class’ Filter out DOM nodes having
     specified class.  Valid class values are available via completion.
‘M-e’
     ‘eww-view-dom-not-having-elements’ Filter out specified element DOM
     nodes.  Valid element names are available via completion.
‘M-i’
     ‘eww-view-dom-not-having-id’ Dfilter out Display DOM nodes having
     specified ID. Valid id values are available via completion.
‘M-r’
     ‘eww-view-dom-not-having-role’ Filter out DOM nodes having
     specified role.  Valid role values are available via completion.

12.75.3 Diving Into (Focusing) On Specific Content
--------------------------------------------------

Contrast this with filtering described in the previous section.  There,
we discussed commands that _filter_ the DOM to render specific types of
elements.  For HTML as spoken on the Web, there is a separate use-case
that is helpful as a dual to filtering, namely, displaying a specific
portion of a page, typically the contents of a ‘div’ element.  These
elements often appear many times on a page, and can be deeply nested,
making it difficult to focus on the relevant content on the page, e.g.
news sites.  Commands ‘emacspeak-eww-dive-into-div’ help in such cases,
‘C-d’ renders the ‘div’ containing point in a separate buffer As with
the filtering commands, ‘l’ returns to the buffer where these commands
were executed.  Long-term users of Emacspeak who still remember Emacs-W3
will recognize this as the _focus_ command implemented by Emacspeak for
W3.

12.75.4 Updated Commands For Following Links
--------------------------------------------

These key-bindings are available when point is on a link.  They enable
context-specific actions for following links, e.g., to play media
streams, or to open various feed-types such as ‘ATOM’, ‘RSS’, or ‘OPML’.

‘k’
     ‘shr-copy-url’ Copy URL under point to the kill-ring.
‘;’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-play-media-at-point’ Play media URL under point
     using ‘emacs-m-player’.  Handles URL fragment as time-stamp where
     we resume; use ‘J’ in M-Player to jump to that offset.
‘U’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-curl-play-media-at-point’ Play media url under point
     by first downloading the URL using CURL. This is useful for sites
     that do multiple redirects before returning the actual media stream
     URL.
‘u’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-url-to-register’ Accumulate url under point to
     register‘u’.  Sample use-cases include building up a playlist of
     links in the right sort order after a YT search.
‘x’
     ‘emacspeak-feeds-select-feed’ Display link under point as an
     ‘ATOM’, ‘OPML’ or ‘RSS’ feed.
‘y’
     ‘empv-play’ Play link -under point as a Youtube stream.

12.75.5 Table Browsing
----------------------

Summary Of Keyboard Commands:
   • ‘M-<left>’ emacspeak-eww-table-previous-cell -- Speak previous
     cell.
   • ‘M-<right>’ emacspeak-eww-table-next-cell -- Speak previous cell.
   • ‘M-<up>’ emacspeak-eww-table-previous-row -- Speak cell above.
   • ‘M-<down>’ emacspeak-eww-table-next-row -- Speak cell below.
   • ‘M-.’ emacspeak-eww-table-speak-cell -- Speak current cell.
   • ‘M-,’ emacspeak-eww-table-speak-dimensions -- Speak number of rows
     and columns.
   • ‘C-t’ emacspeak-eww-table-data -- Browse this table in Emacspeak's
     Table UI -- *Note emacspeak-table-ui::.

   Emacspeak EWW supports table navigation via keys ‘M-.’, ‘M-LEFT’ and
‘M-RIGHT’, to speak the current, previous and next table cell
respectively.  The latter commands also move to the cell being spoken.
You can get a sense of the table's size via ‘M-,’ which speaks the
number of rows and cells in the table.  This works for plain tables, not
nested tables; for nested tables, first have then _unnested_ using one
of the XSLT transforms like ‘sort-tables’.

12.75.6 Miscellaneous Commands

‘C-RET’
     ‘emacspeak-eww-fillin-form-field’ When on an input field, insert
     username/password information accessed via auth-source.

12.75.8 EWW And EBooks On The Emacspeak Audio Desktop
-----------------------------------------------------

Modules emacspeak-epub and emacspeak-bookshare provide EBook front-ends
to EPub-2 and Daisy EBooks.  Both modules now use EWW to render these
EBooks.  Module emacspeak-eww provides a simple bookmarking facility --
called eww-marks (to avoid confusion with EWW's Web Bookmarks).  When
reading an EBook, you can use ‘m’ to create an EWW-mark at that
position.  These marks are automatically saved across Emacs sessions.
To open a previously created eww-mark, use command
‘emacspeak-eww-open-mark’ bound to ‘C-x r e’.  This command reads a
eww-mark name with completion.  Use this command with an interactive
prefix arg to delete a previously created eww-mark.
