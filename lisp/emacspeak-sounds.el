;;; Commentary:
;; This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons.
;;  It also defines sound themes for auditory icons.
;; @subsection Design goal:
;;
;; @itemize
;; @item   Auditory icons should be used to
;; provide additional feedback, not as a gimmick.
;; @item   The Emacspeak interface
;; should be usable at all times with the icons turned off.
;; @item  Command @code{emacspeak-toggle-auditory-icons} toggles the
;; use of auditory icons. This flag is buffer-local; use an
;; interactive prefix argosy @code{C-u} to toggle auditory icons on/off
;; globally.
;; @item  Use @code{setq-default emacspeak-use-auditory-icons nil)} to turn
;; auditory icons  off at startup; default is to use auditory icons globally.
;; @item   General principle for using auditory icons:
;; @enumerate
;; @item Convey information about events taking place in parallel.
;;@item  For instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current
;; focus to the next choice, We speak the next choice, while
;; indicating the fact that something was selected with an auditory
;; icon.
;; @item Speed up task completion --- auditory icons take less time than
;; the accompanying spoken feedback.
;; @end enumerate
;; @item This module provides  a mapping between names in the elisp
;; world and actual sound files.
;; @item icon names are symbols,
;; sound files  are strings ---  fully-qualified file-names.
;; @item Modules that  use auditory icons
;;  use icon names and not  actual file names.
;; @item Icons are played either using a local player, or by sending
;; appropriate commands to the speech server (local or cloud).
;; @item  This is determined by the value of @code{emacspeak-play-program}.
;; @item As of
;; Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes architecture for
;; auditory icons.  Sound files corresponding to a given theme are
;; found in appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-dir.
;; @item There are two supported themes: @code{ogg-chimes} and @code{ogg-3d}.
;; @item Contrast this with @code{prompts} --- they  dont belong to any theme.
;; @end itemize
;; @subsection Designing Auditory Icons
;; Here are some notes on what I have learnt while designing and using
;; auditory icons over the years:
;; @enumerate
;;@item  Auditory icons should be short  --- use command @code{soxi} or
;; @code{;} in a dired buffer to see duration of a sound file. Use
;; the bundled themes as a guide.
;; @item Sounds have many properties, eg: duration, gain, pitch, at
;; the basic level.
;;@item  Even more important is the nature of the sound and what it sounds
;; like in the context of the overall speech output  where that sound is used.
;; @item This is why  the gain of icons  @emph{should never be} normalized in
;; my view---  tuning icons is as complex as picking
;; colors from  a color palette.
;; @item The included themes have been optimized over years of use and
;; are primarily tuned for using with headphones.
;; @end enumerate
;; If @code{emacspeak-play-program} is set to @code{nil},
;; we serve icons, otherwise play
;;them using a local player.
